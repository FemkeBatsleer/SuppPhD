A total of 22 foraging trips by five bees with transponders lasted on average 22.9 +- 5.6 min, while 27 trips made by the same bees before transponder attachment lasted on average 12.8 +- 2.5 min. Bees fitted with transponders, trips out the nest lasted on average 83.8 + 8.5 min. Trips for these bees before transponder attachment lasted an average of 56.5 + 4.4 min.;They suspect that difference in foraging time is mainly due to handling time of the bees on individual flowers, and is not an impact of the wieght on the flight performance

Except for the lighter extra weights, there was a tendency for a smaller total number of flights.;However, the ability of many insects to carry heavy loads in flight must be distinguished from the ability of these insects to carry extra loads without negatively affecting flight performance. It is likely that maximum loads for flight all affect some aspects of flight performance.'

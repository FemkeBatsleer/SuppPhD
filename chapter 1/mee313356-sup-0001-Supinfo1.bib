abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd. The yellow-legged Asian hornet is an invasive species of wasps, indigenous of the South-East Asia but quickly spreading in Southern Europe. Because of its exponential diffusion and its serious threat to the local honey bee colonies and to humans as well, restraint measures are under investigation. Among them, the harmonic radar described in (Ecology and Evolution, 6, 2016 and 2170) already proved to be a quite effective way to follow the hornets to their nests; it is in fact capable of tracking the flying trajectory of these insects, once equipped with a small transponder, in their natural environment. The aforementioned harmonic radar was upgraded after a period of intense experimentation; the capture of the hornets was enhanced as well, and other improvements were adopted in the mounting procedure of the transponder. Thanks to these upgrades, the flying capabilities of the hornets were not reduced and a huge collection of data was recorded. The main upgrade to the radar was the adoption of the vertical polarization of the radiated field, with the consequent redesign and manufacturing of the antennas and the different mounting of the transceiver on the insect. The installation of the radar on a telescopic tower drastically improved the maneuverability of the system and the capability to follow the insects' preferential flying directions. Eventually, the system was able to produce much more continuous traces with a clear indication of the most probable position of the nest. The maximum range of detection was also increased to 150 m.},

abstract = {The Asian honey bee Apis cerana and the European honey bee Apis mellifera are closely related and morphologically very similar. Where these species coexist, they appear to compete, but the outcomes of competition vary enormously between locations. Here, we report comparative behavioural data for A. cerana and A. mellifera in China gathered by tracking bees using radio frequency identification. Both species organise their division of labour by temporal polyethism and have remarkably similar demographic structure. Analyses of the homing capacities of both species following large-scale displacement suggest that A. mellifera colonies have a larger range than A. cerana. We observed that relocation of A. mellifera to a new environment disrupted colony function for 3 weeks. Our data show that A. mellifera and. A cerana occupy extremely similar behavioural niches, and therefore, the potential for competition between these species is very high. {\textcopyright} 2012 INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag, France.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Although portable harmonic radar system and fluorescent marking system are two widely used detection methods, their comparative effectiveness has not been studied. Therefore, we first tested the applicability of fluorescent marking system on Riptortus pedestris (Hemiptera: Alydidae). Then, we evaluated the efficacy of the two methods used either alone or combined in a grass field and bean field, varying with complexity, during day and night. RESULTS Fluorescent marking did not affect the behavior or fitness of Riptortus pedestris except for vertical walking, while allowing the detection from {\textgreater}25 m when paired with a handheld laser. Generally, the portable harmonic radar system and both methods combined were more successful in sample detection, although the fluorescent marking system in the bean field at night was as competitive as the two. Combining both methods made sample retrieval easier at night than the portable harmonic radar system. Nevertheless, the total detection time showed a large variance across the methods. CONCLUSION The portable harmonic radar system can be an effective detection method in either landscape during both day and night. Furthermore, the fluorescent marking system can be a reliable tool at night as well. Lastly, combining both methods can improve the night detection. (c) 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

abstract = {The European gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar L., is an invasive insect in North America that feeds on over 300 species of trees and shrubs and occasionally causes extensive defoliation. One regulatory practice within quarantine zones to slow the spread of this insect recommends that wood products (e.g., logs, pulpwood) originating from quarantine areas are staged within 100 foot-radius buffer zones devoid of host vegetation before transport outside the quarantine boundary. Currently, there are little data underpinning the distance used. We conducted field experiments in Wisconsin to assess buffer zone efficacy in reducing risk of larval gypsy moth encroachment on wood staging areas. We released late-instar gypsy moth larvae in groups around the perimeter of a 100-ft radius zone and tracked their movements for 10-h periods using harmonic radar and tested whether host vegetation staged around the perimeter or food availability before release altered movement patterns. Three larvae moved over 300 ft in 10 h, but 93{\%} of larvae moved {\textless}100 ft total. The presence of host vegetation reduced the likelihood of larvae entering the buffer zone by 70{\%}. Food availability before release did not affect movement. Using these field data, we parameterized a Monte Carlo simulation model to evaluate risk of larvae crossing zones of different sizes. For zones {\textgreater}100 ft in radius, {\textless}4{\%} of larvae reached the center. This percentage decreased as zone size increased. Implications of these results for the regulatory practices of the gypsy moth quarantine are discussed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019, The Author(s). The dispersal of animals from their birth place has profound effects on the immediate survival and longer-term persistence of populations. Molecular studies have estimated that bumblebee colonies can be established many kilometers from their queens' natal nest site. However, little is known about when and how queens disperse during their lifespan. One possible life stage when dispersal may occur, is directly after emerging from hibernation. Here, harmonic radar tracking of artificially over-wintered Bombus terrestris queens shows that they spend most of their time resting on the ground with intermittent very short flights (duration and distance). We corroborate these behaviors with observations of wild queen bees, which show similar prolonged resting periods between short flights, indicating that the behavior of our radar-monitored bees was not due to the attachment of transponders nor an artifact of the bees being commercially reared. Radar-monitored flights were not continuously directed away from the origin, suggesting that bees were not intentionally trying to disperse from their artificial emergence site. Flights did not loop back to the origin suggesting bees were not trying to remember or get back to the original release site. Most individuals dispersed from the range of the harmonic radar within less than two days and did not return. Flight directions were not different from a uniform distribution and flight lengths followed an exponential distribution, both suggesting random dispersal. A random walk model based on our observed data estimates a positive net dispersal from the origin over many flights, indicating a biased random dispersal, and estimates the net displacement of queens to be within the range of those estimated in genetic studies. We suggest that a distinct post-hibernation life history stage consisting mostly of rest with intermittent short flights and infrequent foraging fulfils the dual purpose of ovary development and dispersal prior to nest searching.},

abstract = {There is increasing worldwide concern about the impacts of pesticide residues on honey bees and bee colony survival, but how sublethal effects of pesticides on bees might cause colony failure remains highly controversial, with field data giving very mixed results. To explore how trace levels of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid impacted colony foraging performance, we equipped bees with RFID tags that allowed us to track their lifetime flight behavior. One group of bees was exposed to a trace concentration (5 $\mu$g/kg, ppb) of imidacloprid in sugar syrup while in the larval stage. The imidacloprid residues caused bees to start foraging when younger as adults and perform fewer orientation flights, and reduced their lifetime foraging flights by 28{\%}. The magnitude of the effects of a trace imidacloprid concentration delivered only during larval stage highlights the severity of pesticide residues for bee foraging performance. Our data suggest that neonicotinoids could impact colony function by imbalancing the normal age based division of labor in a colony and reducing foraging efficiency. Understanding this mechanism will help the development of interventions to safeguard bee colony health. ■},

abstract = {Detecting the arbitrary movements of fast-moving insects under field conditions is notoriously difficult because existing technologies are limited by issues of size, weight, range and cost. Here, we establish proof-of-concept for a prototype long-range, passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tagging system for detecting bumblebees and similar sized insects. The prototype tags, weighing 81 mg (49{\%} of mean bee body weight), were flown by bumblebees in a glasshouse and detected at a distance of 1.5 m from a 2 W UHF reader with two aerials. This detection distance is two orders of magnitude greater than existing RFID tags that can be flown by medium-sized bees and, thus, is a significant breakthrough for insect tracking that could be applied to plant conservation and restoration efforts in fragmented landscapes. Proof-of-concept has been successfully established and, with further development, we are likely to optimize the system by reducing tag size and weight to limit effects on bee behaviour, and by increasing the detection distance. We envisage the production system being used to detect and track bee movement pathways within a designed network of field-deployed low-cost readers and aerials. The production system could be used in a wide variety of scientific and commercial applications.},

abstract = {The concept of response threshold (RT) has been developed to explain task allocation in social insect colonies, wherein individual workers engage in tasks depending on their responsiveness to the task-related stimulus. Moreover, a mathematical model of RT has been proposed to explain data obtained from task allocation experiments; however, its applicability range warrants clarification through adequate quantitative analysis. Hence, we used an automatic measuring system to count passage events between a nest chamber and a foraging arena in five colonies of ants, Camponotus japonicus. The events were measured using radio-frequency identification tags attached to all workers of each colony. Here, we examined the detailed forms of i) labour distribution during foraging among workers in each colony and ii) the persistence of rank-order of foraging among workers. We found that labour distribution was characterized by a generalized gamma-distribution, indicating that only few workers carried out a large part of the workload. The rank-order of foraging activity among workers in each colony was maintained for a month and collapsed within a few months. We compared the obtained data with testable predictions of the RT model. The comparison indicated that proper evaluation of the mathematical model is required based on the obtained data.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by the Ecological Society of America Floral resources and natural enemies are considered important drivers of wild bee population dynamics, yet there is little information on how these factors, either independently or in combination, influence the demographic performance of bees. Bumble bees (Bombus spp.), ecologically important social insects, have long colony cycles lasting many weeks. Food shortfalls during the colony lifetime can result in smaller colony sizes and lower reproductive output. Conopid flies (Conopidae, Diptera) are prevalent endoparasitoids of bumble bees, often infecting high percentages of free-flying individuals. Conopids can reduce worker life span and foraging efficiency; consequently, they may negatively affect colony success. In this study, we evaluated how seasonal variability in food resources and conopid parasitism together influence the productivity of bumble bee colonies through construction of a simulation model. In addition to simulating colony performance in relation to a defined food environment and conopid-induced worker mortality, we evaluated how daily background mortality risk and the timing of colony initiation affected growth and reproductive outcomes of colonies, as well as the degree of influence exerted by conopids. Model parameters were largely informed by field data collected from Bombus impatiens colonies at our study site (Blandy Experimental Farm, Boyce, Virginia, USA), including data on forager risk of conopid parasitism as assessed using radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology. In spite of the high probability of parasitism (4{\%} per hour of flight during seasonal peak) incorporated into our model simulations, lethal parasitism by conopids generally had a modest influence on colony productivity, reducing reproductive output by 15{\%} or less across most tested scenarios. However, conopids were more influential under very low resource conditions, reducing reproductive output by 21–28{\%}. Inclusion of sublethal effects of conopids on foraging activity further reduced colony performance in all scenarios, but had a greater impact on colony performance under the poorest resource conditions. This work emphasizes that the importance of natural enemies to the demographic performance of bees can increase under certain environmental conditions and highlights the value of using models to consider multiple stressors that are difficult to evaluate simultaneously in field experiments.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Minahan and Brunet. Central place foragers depart from and return to a central location with enough resources for themselves, and in many cases, for the group. Honey bees and bumble bees are eusocial central place foragers. Honey bees have large perennial colonies while bumble bee colonies are annual and considerably smaller. Foraging range, body size, and division of labor also vary between these two bee species. Honey bees use their unique dance language to recruit foragers to the most profitable patches. Bumble bees exploit patches individually and develop trapline foraging patterns. We expect such differences among bee species to engender differences in foraging activity. Moreover, variation in resource availability and in colony needs over the flowering season, can affect bee foraging activity. Finally, spatial variation in resource availability may impact bumble bees to a greater extent than honey bees due to their smaller foraging range. Using miniaturized radio frequency identification (RFID), we tracked the foraging activity of individual bees to and from hives at three sites and over five time periods. Pollen pellets were also collected from bees returning to the hive. We compared the European honey bee, Apis mellifera, and the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens. Linear mixed effect models determined the impact of bee species, time of season (period) and site, and their interactions, on multiple foraging metrics calculated from the RFID data and on pollen dry weight. Relative to honey bees, individual bumble bees made more foraging trips each day, resulting in a greater time spent foraging. A greater proportion of RFID tagged bumble bees foraged each day and bumble bees brought heavier pollen sacs to the hive compared to honey bees. Foraging bout duration did not vary between bee species and none of the foraging metrics varied among time periods or among sites. Both bee species brought heavier pollen sacs back to the hive at the beginning and the end of the flowering season. These results are discussed in terms of species differences in foraging strategies, size of individuals and colonies, and temporal variation in colony needs and resource availability.},

abstract = {Storms are usually accompanied by a drop in temperature, and an increase in wind and barometric pressure and rainfall, which have negative impacts on most activities, survival and reproduction in insects (Gillot, 2005). The majority of studies mainly focused on how the flight activity of various flying insects such as honeybees, bumble bees, horse flies and leafminer were directly influenced by intraday weather changes (Burnett {\&} Hays, 1974; Lundberg, 1980; Casas, 1989; Vicens {\&} Bosch, 2000). However, accumulating evidences showed that animals can make behavioral changes before storms, which is enormously important for their survival in severe weather condition. Before upcoming storms birds unusually chirp and bathe with sand; native frogs croak and hide their eggs masses; spiders spin shorter and produce thicker webs and wasps hide their comb before rains (Galacgac {\&} Balisacan, 2009; Acharya, 2011). In early 1893, honeybees were reported more active before storms (Inwards, 1893). In this study, we compared the working habits of foragers on days that were followed by a sunny day and those that followed by a rainy day using the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) which was developed and manufactured by the Honeybee Research Institute of Jiangxi Agricultural University in collaboration with the Guangzhou Invengo Information Technology Co., Ltd., and we firstly showed that honeybees worked harder before a rainy day.

abstract = {Honeybee foragers frequently fly several kilometres to and from vital resources, and communicate those locations to their nest mates by a symbolic dance language. Research has shown that they achieve this feat by memorizing landmarks and the skyline panorama, using the sun and polarized skylight as compasses and by integrating their outbound flight paths. In order to investigate the capacity of the honeybees' homing abilities, we artificially displaced foragers to novel release spots at various distances up to 13 km in the four cardinal directions. Returning bees were individually registered by a radio frequency identification (RFID) system at the hive entrance. We found that homing rate, homing speed and the maximum homing distance depend on the release direction. Bees released in the east were more likely to find their way back home, and returned faster than bees released in any other direction, due to the familiarity of global landmarks seen from the hive. Our findings suggest that such large scale homing is facilitated by global landmarks acting as beacons, and possibly the entire skyline panorama.},

The European honey bee, Apis mellifera is one of the world's most important generalist pollinators, and Nosema apis is a widespread microsporidian gut parasite of adult A. mellifera. We individually fed 960 newly eclosed A. mellifera workers either a sucrose solution or 400 N. apis spores in a sucrose solution and tagged them with a unique radio frequency identification (RFID) tag to monitor their foraging behavior. We found spore-fed bees were less likely to forage than those fed sugar only. Those that did forage started foraging when they were older and stopped foraging when they were younger than bees fed sugar only. However, inoculated and non-inoculated bees did not significantly differ in the number of foraging trips taken per day, the total hours foraged over their lifetime, or homing ability. Inoculated returning foragers were 4.3 times less likely to be carrying available pollen than non-inoculated returning foragers and the number of pollen grains carried was negatively correlated with the number of N. apis spores. In an arena of artificial flowers, inoculated bees had a tendency (. p=. 0.061) to choose sugar flowers over pollen flowers, compared to non-inoculated bees which visited pollen and sugar flowers equally. These results demonstrate that even a relatively low dose of a widespread disease of A. mellifera may adversely affect bees' ability to pollinate.},

abstract = {Three experiments were performed to determine why removal of the corpora allata (the glands that produce juvenile hormone) causes honey bees to fail to return to their hive upon initiating flight. In Experiment 1, the naturally occurring flights of allatectomized bees were tracked with radar to determine whether the deficit is physical or cognitive. The results indicated a physical impairment: allatectomized bees had a significantly slower ground speed than sham and untreated bees during orientation flights, but otherwise attributes such as flight range and area were normal. Flight impairment was confirmed in Experiment 2, based on observations of takeoff made in the field at the hive entrance. The allatectomized group had a significantly small er percentage of flightworthy bees than did the sham and untreated groups. Experiment 3 confirmed the flight impairment in laboratory tests and showed that allatectomy causes a decrease in metabolic rate. Allatectomized bees had significantly lower metabolic rates than untreated and sham bees, while allatectomized bees receiving hormone replacement had intermediate values. These results indicate that allatectomy causes flight impairment, probably partly due to effects on metabolic rate. They also suggest that juvenile hormone plays an additional, previously unknown, role in coordinating the physiological underpinning of division of labor in honey bee colonies.},

abstract = {Sleep is known to support memory consolidation in animals, including humans. Here we ask whether consolidation of novel navigation memory in honeybees depends on sleep. Foragers were exposed to a forced navigation task in which they learned to home more efficiently from an unexpected release site by acquiring navigational memory during the successful homing flight. This task was quantified using harmonic radar tracking and applied to bees that were equipped with a radio frequency identification device (RFID). The RFID was used to record their outbound and inbound flights and continuously monitor their behavior inside the colony, including their rest during the day and sleep at night. Bees marked with the RFID behaved normally inside and outside the hive. Bees slept longer during the night following forced navigation tasks, but foraging flights of different lengths did not lead to different rest times during the day or total sleep time during the night. Sleep deprivation before the forced navigation task did not alter learning and memory acquired during the task. However, sleep deprivation during the night after forced navigation learning reduced the probability of returning successfully to the hive from the same release site. It is concluded that consolidation of novel navigation memory is facilitated by night sleep in bees.},

abstract = {In his classic studies on honeybee navigation, von Frisch had to rely on qualitative visual observations of the bees' flight paths, but nevertheless reached the surprising conclusion that bees seem to anticipate lateral wind drift and compensate by flying in shallow curves on the upwind side of their intended tracks,. We have investigated wind compensation with much greater precision by using radar, to record the flight trajectories of individual bumble-bees (Bombus terrestris L.) foraging over arable farmland. Flights typically covered distances of 200 to 700 metres, but bees maintained direct routes between the forage areas and their nests, even in winds with a strong cross-track component. Some bees overcompensated slightly, as described by von Frisch, but most stayed on course byheading partly into the wind and moving obliquely over the ground.},

Four type of colored hybrid films were deposited using precursor solutions with the reactants molar ratio 1:0.5:1 for TEOS: TMSPM:MMA, respectively, and four different weight contents of the organic red dye. The hybrid films were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and optical transmission and reflection spectroscopy. The hardness of the films was determined from a pencil hardness test referred to ASTM Standard D 3363-92. The results showed that the colored hybrid films have a thickness of about 2 mm and consist of a homogeneous cross-linked organic–inorganic matrix with embedded dye molecules very well dispersed. The hardness of the hybrid films was enhanced with respect to that of the pure organic component. The AFM measurements showed very flat and smooth film surfaces with rms average roughness about 0.3 nm. The optical properties of the hybrid films including their color properties were determined from optical transmission and reflection spectroscopy. We found that the intensity of the color in the hybrid films and the corresponding color coordinates depend on the amount of red dye in the hybrid films. Photodegradation studies were performed by monitoring the optical density of the films as a function of the exposure time to illumination for several values of illumination intensity.},

abstract = {Honey bee health is mainly affected by Varroa destructor, viruses, Nosema spp., pesticide residues and poor nutrition. Interactions between these proposed factors may be responsible for the colony losses reported worldwide in recent years. In the present study, the effects of a honey bee virus, Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), on the foraging behaviors and homing ability of European honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) were investigated based on proboscis extension response (PER) assays and radio frequency identification (RFID) systems. The pollen forager honey bees originated from colonies that had no detectable level of honey bee viruses and were manually inoculated with IAPV to induce the viral infection. The results showed that IAPV-inoculated honey bees were more responsive to low sucrose solutions compared to that of non-infected foragers. After two days of infection, around 10⁷ copies of IAPV were detected in the heads of these honey bees. The homing ability of IAPV-infected foragers was depressed significantly in comparison to the homing ability of uninfected foragers. The data provided evidence that IAPV infection in the heads may enable the virus to disorder foraging roles of honey bees and to interfere with brain functions that are responsible for learning, navigation, and orientation in the honey bees, thus, making honey bees have a lower response threshold to sucrose and lose their way back to the hive.},

abstract = {This study was designed to assess homing behaviour of bees foraging on winter oilseed rape grown from seed treated with thiamethoxam (as Cruiser OSR) with one field drilled with thiamethoxam treated seed and two control fields drilled with fungicide-only treated seed. Twelve honeybee colonies were used per treatment group, 4 each located at the field edge (on-field site), at approximately 500m (0.5 Km site) and 1000?m (1.0 Km site) from the field. A total of nearly 300 newly-emerged bees were fitted (tagged) with Mic3 RFID transponders (tags) and introduced into each of the 36 study hives. RFID readers fitted to the entrances of the test colonies were used to monitor the activity of the tagged bees for the duration of 5 week flowering period of the crop. These activity data were analysed to assess any impact on flight activity of bees foraging on the treated compared to untreated crops. Honeybees were seen to be actively foraging within all three treatment groups during the exposure period. The data for the over 3000 RFID tagged bees and over 90,000 foraging flights monitored throughout the exposure phase for the study follow the same trends across the treatment and controls and at each of the three apiary distances, indicating that there were no effects from foraging on the treated crop. Under the conditions of this experiment there was no effect of foraging on thiamethoxam treated oilseed rape on their flight activity or on their ability to return to the hive.

abstract = {An analysis is presented of the first harmonic radar studies of pheromone-plume locating flights of male Agrotis segetum moths over distances of up to 500 m. Upon release most moths flew in a direction having a downwind component. The first significant changes in flight orientations occur in the immediate vicinity of a pheromone source. Moths that were initially flying downwind change course and start flying crosswind whilst those that initially flew crosswind change course and start flying upwind. It is shown that such behaviour is consistent with the adoption of an effective plume-location strategy, and conditions are identified when downwind flights would be more advantageous than crosswind ones. Additionally, some of the complex flight patterns that can arise at later times are shown to be compatible with the adoption of an optimal biased scale-free (L{\'{e}}vy-flight) searching strategy. It is found that disruptive doses of sex pheromone can have a marked influence upon male moth flight patterns. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Nectar-feeding animals have served as the subjects of many experimental studies and theoretical models of foraging. Their willingness to visit artificial feeders renders many species amenable to controlled experiments using mechanical "flowers" that replenish nectar automatically. However, the structural complexity of such feeders and the lack of a device for tracking the movements of multiple individuals have limited our ability to ask some specific questions related to natural foraging contexts, especially in competitive situations. To overcome such difficulties, we developed an experimental system for producing computer records of multiple foragers harvesting from simple artificial flowers with known rates of nectar secretion, using radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to identify individual animals. By using infrared detectors (light-emitting diodes and phototransistors) to activate the RFID readers momentarily when needed, our system prevents the RFID chips from heating up and disturbing the foraging behavior of focal animals. To demonstrate these advantages, we performed a preliminary experiment with a captive colony of bumble bees, Bombus impatiens. In the experiment, two bees were tagged with RFID chips (2.5 x 2.5 mm, manufactured by Hitachi-Maxell, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and allowed to forage on 16 artificial flowers arranged in a big flight cage. Using the resulting data set, we present details of how the bees increased their travel speed between flowers, while decreasing the average nectar crop per flower, as they gained experience. Our system provides a powerful tool to track the movement patterns, reward history, and long-term foraging performance of individual foragers at large spatial scales.},

To prevent establishment or reduce the rate of spread of V. velutina, early detection and destruction of nests is considered the only option. Detection is difficult as their nests are well hidden and flying hornets are difficult to follow over long distances. We address this challenge by tracking individual V. velutina workers flying back to their nests using radio telemetry for the first time, finding five previously undiscovered nests, up to 1.33 km from hornet release points. Hornets can fly with 0.28 g tags if the tag:hornet ratio is less than 0.8. This method offers a step-change in options to tackle the spread of this invader, providing an efficient means of finding V. velutina nests in complex environments to manage this emerging threat to pollinators.},

abstract = {Positive size assortative mating can arise if either one or both sexes prefer bigger mates or if the success of larger males in contests for larger females leaves smaller males to mate with smaller females. Moreover, body size could not only influence pairing patterns before copulation but also the covariance between female size and size of ejaculate (number of spermatophores) transferred to a mate. In this field study, we examine the pre-copulatory mate choice, as well as insemination, patterns in the Cook Strait giant weta (Deinacrida rugosa). D. rugosa is a large orthopteran insect that exhibits strong female-biased sexual dimorphism, with females being nearly twice as heavy as males. Contrary to the general expectation of male preference for large females in insects with female-biased size dimorphism, we found only weak support for positive size assortative mating based on size (tibia length). Interestingly, although there was no correlation between male body size and the number of spermatophores transferred, we did find that males pass more spermatophores to lighter females. This pattern of sperm transfer does not appear to be a consequence of those males that mate heavier females being sperm depleted. Instead, males may provide lighter females with more spermatophores perhaps because these females pose less of a sperm competition risk to mates},

abstract = {Many individual decisions are informed by direct comparison of the alternatives. In collective decisions, however, only certain group members may have the opportunity to compare options. Emigrating ant colonies (Temnothorax albipennis) show sophisticated nest-site choice, selecting superior sites even when they are nine times further away than the alternative. How do they do this? We used radio-frequency identification-tagged ants to monitor individual behaviour. Here we show for the first time that switching between nests during the decision process can influence nest choice without requiring direct comparison of nests. Ants finding the poor nest were likely to switch and find the good nest, whereas ants finding the good nest were more likely to stay committed to that nest. When ants switched quickly between the two nests, colonies chose the good nest. Switching by ants that had the opportunity to compare nests had little effect on nest choice. We suggest a new mechanism of collective nest choice: individuals respond to nest quality by the decision either to commit or to seek alternatives. Previously proposed mechanisms, recruitment latency and nest comparison, can be explained as side effects of this simple rule. Colony-level comparison and choice can emerge, without direct comparison by individuals.},

abstract = {Ant colonies are factories within fortresses (Oster and Wilson 1978). They run on resources foraged from an outside world fraught with danger. On what basis do individual ants decide to leave the safety of the nest? We investigated the relative roles of social information (returning nestmates), individual experience and physiology (lipid stores/corpulence) in predicting which ants leave the nest and when. We monitored Temnothorax albipennis workers individually using passive radio-frequency identification technology, a novel procedure as applied to ants. This method allowed the matching of individual corpulence measurements to activity patterns of large numbers of individuals over several days. Social information and physiology are both good predictors of when an ant leaves the nest. Positive feedback from social information causes bouts of activity at the colony level. When certain social information is removed from the system by preventing ants returning, physiology best predicts which ants leave the nest and when. Individual experience is strongly related to physiology. A small number of lean individuals are responsible for most external trips. An individual's nutrient status could be a useful cue in division of labour, especially when public information from other ants is unavailable.},

abstract = {Flexibility in task performance is essential for a robust system of division of labour. We investigated what factors determine which social insect workers respond to colony-level changes in task demand. We used radio-frequency identification technology to compare the roles of corpulence, age, spatial location and previous activity (intra-nest/extra-nest) in determining whether worker ants (Temnothorax albipennis) respond to an increase in demand for foraging or brood care. The less corpulent ants took on the extra foraging, irrespective of their age, previous activity or location in the nest, supporting a physiological threshold model. We found no relationship between ants that tended the extra brood and corpulence, age, spatial location or previous activity, but ants that transported the extra brood to the main brood pile were less corpulent and had high previous intra-nest activity. This supports spatial task-encounter and physiological threshold models for brood transport. Our data suggest a flexible task-allocation system allowing the colony to respond rapidly to changing needs, using a simple task-encounter system for generalized tasks, combined with physiologically based response thresholds for more specialized tasks. This could provide a social insect colony with a robust division of labour, flexibly allocating the workforce in response to current needs.},

The role of environmental cues in influencing the movement direction of migratory bands is poorly understood and has been the subject of little empirical study. We examined the effect of wind direction on Mormon cricket migratory band movement direction by monitoring the local weather conditions and daily movement patterns of individual insects traveling in bands over the same time course at three close, but spatially distinct sites. Although weather conditions were relatively homogeneous across sites, wind directions tended to be more variable across sites during the morning hours, the period during which directional movement begins. Migratory bands at different sites traveled in distinctly different directions. However, we failed to find any evidence to suggest that the observed variation in migratory band movement direction was correlated with local wind direction at any time during the day. These results support the notion that the cues mediating migratory band directionality are likely to be group specific and that a role for landscape-scale environmental cues such as wind direction is unlikely.},

Immune defence is particularly relevant to survival in migratory bands, but little is known about the role of nutrition in insect immunocompetence. We hypothesised that immune defences are compromised in these migratory bands due to nutrient limitations. 2. In a migratory band in Utah, we investigated whether access to a protein relative to a carbohydrate diet would immediately reduce migratory activity, as had been shown for Mormon crickets in a previous study in Idaho, and whether the protein diet would enhance immune defence responses. 3. Radio-tracking Mormon crickets in the field, we found that locomotor activity was significantly and positively associated with body mass. Body mass-adjusted locomotor activity declined marginally following access to a protein diet, whereas spontaneous phenoloxidase (PO) activity was enhanced by the same diet. The encapsulation response and lysozyme-like activity were directly proportional to body mass, but unaffected by the dietary treatments in the short term. Within 6 h of feeding on protein or carbohydrates, Mormon crickets exhibited measurable effects on the immune system. 4. We conclude that nutrition impacts immune function in migrating insects in the field. Spontaneous PO activity may be limited by dietary deficiency in a protein-seeking band of Mormon crickets.},

abstract = {Kin-selection theory underlies our basic understanding of social evolution [1, 2]. Nest drifting in eusocial insects (where workers move between nests) presents a challenge to this paradigm, since a worker should remain as a helper on her natal colony, rather than visit other colonies to which she is less closely related. Here we reveal nest drifting as a strategy by which workers may maximize their indirect fitness by helping on several related nests, preferring those where the marginal return from their help is greatest. By using a novel monitoring technique, radio frequency identification (RFID) tagging, we provide the first accurate estimate of drifting in a eusocial insect: 56{\%} of females drifted in a natural population of the eusocial paper wasp Polistes canadensis, exceeding previous records of drifting in natural populations by more than 30-fold. We demonstrate that drifting cannot be explained through social parasitism, queen succession, mistakes in nest identity, or methodological bias. Instead, workers appear to gain indirect fitness benefits by helping on several related colonies in a viscous population structure. The potential importance of this strategy as a component of the kin-selected benefits for a social insect worker has previously been overlooked because of methodological difficulties in quantifying and studying drifting. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Butterflies originating from large continuous populations and from old local populations in Finland exhibited similar movement behaviors, whereas butterflies originating from newly established local populations in the fragmented landscape in Finland moved significantly more than the others. There was no difference in the lengths of individual flight bouts, but the new-population females flew more frequently, resulting in longer daily movement tracks.

abstract = {Appropriate monitoring tools are essential for assessing the effectiveness of management for all threatened insect taxa. In New Zealand the large-bodied flightless orthopterans in the genus Deinacrida have mostly been monitored by searching through habitat during the day or spotlighting at night but this is time consuming and the results depend on the skill of the searcher. Recently, footprint tracking tunnels, similar to those used for monitoring small mammals in New Zealand, were found to be effective for detecting adults of various giant weta species. In this study, we compared the abundance of Cook Strait giant weta (CSGW) in the vicinity of the tunnels, estimated by mark-recapture, with the number of tracking tunnels tracked by weta. We found strong indications that both baited and unbaited tracking tunnels can be used to estimate the number of adult weta present but that this probably depends on their responses to meteorological conditions which are not yet understood. Our results also show that footprint tracking tunnels are more effective for detecting adult CSGW than searching for these insects at night and that baiting tracking tunnels with peanut butter increases their effectiveness for detecting adult CSGW. We confirmed how far Cook Strait giant weta moved each night on Matiu-Somes Island by attaching transmitters to them and found that day roosts of three adult males were on average 8.6 m apart each day and those of adult females were on average 21.3 m apart. Both the low recapture rates of marked adult CSGW and the nightly displacements of those with transmitters suggest that adult CSGW show no site fidelity and are clearly capable of moving large distances each night. However, an individual weta is unlikely to track more than one tunnel per night if tunnels are 30 m apart. Tracking tunnels have the potential to be used with some other insects, provided their footprints are diagnostic. An advantage of using tracking tunnels is that they are non-lethal and would therefore be particularly suitable for monitoring other large threatened insect taxa.},

abstract = {Wetapunga (Deinacrida heteracantha), New Zealand's largest insect, were formerly abundant in forests of northern New Zealand. However, they are now restricted to one population on mammal-free Little Barrier Island (3083 ha). This study investigated the movements, habitat use and behavior of 22 adult wetapunga fitted with miniature radiotransmitters for up to 18 nights. Adult wetapunga appeared to be quite mobile, with males (16 m per night) moving further than females (8 m per night). Differences in the distances travelled by adult male and female wetapunga between daytime refuges appear due to differences in reproductive behavior. Wetapunga were associated with silverfern, nikau palm, kanuka, and kohekohe within second-growth coastal forest on Little Barrier Island. The majority of wetapunga were found above ground level, but were also occasionally found moving on the ground. In addition, adult wetapunga were found in relatively open sites with little or no cover and were clearly visible by day. Wetapunga were generally solitary and the majority of their activities, such as feeding, movements and oviposition, occurred at night. The one exception is mating (actual copulation and pre-, post-copulatory behavior), which usually occurred during daylight after weta had paired during the previous night. During the study, one male wetapunga was eaten by an unknown avian predator. Radiotelemetry has extended our knowledge of adult wetapunga behavior and this monitoring technique could be readily applied to other large invertebrates.

abstract = {Social groups are structured by the decisions of their members. Social insects typically divide labour: some decide to stay in the nest while others forage for the colony. Two sources of information individuals may use when deciding whether to forage are their own experience of recent task performance and their own physiology, e.g. fat reserves (corpulence). The former is primarily personal information; the latter may give an indication of the food reserves of the whole colony. These factors are hard to separate because typically leaner individuals are also more experienced foragers. We designed an experiment to determine whether foraging specialisation is physiological or experience based (or both). We invented a system of automatic doors controlled by radio-tag information to manipulate task access and decouple these two sources of information. Our results show that when information from corpulence and recent experience conflict, ants behave only in accordance with their corpulence. However, among ants physiologically inclined to forage (less corpulent ants), recent experience of success positively influenced their propensity to forage again. Hence, foraging is organised via long-term physiological differences among individuals resulting in a relatively stable response threshold distribution, with fine-tuning provided by short-term learning processes. Through these simple rules, colonies can organise their foraging effort both robustly and flexibly.},

Some studies have recently explored several attributes of insect colonies from a network perspective, providing evidence of variation in connectivity patterns among group members.

Odontomachus hastatus were individually equipped with passive microtransponders to collect their spatial positions in artificial nests automatically. Colonies were surveyed for 3 consecutive weeks to build weighted networks of proximity between ants. The analysis revealed important interindividual differences in connectivity patterns and showed that proximity networks were stable over time. The removal of the queen did not impact the patterns of association between workers, confirming that she did not contribute to shaping network structure. Ants forming long-lasting associations with a small number of nestmates exhibited a reduced tendency to move. In contrast, mobile workers were more likely to interact homogeneously with their nestmates and did not display any privileged associations. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

The degree of locomotory activity as well as walking distances was recorded for both males and females. Hungry males and females show a similar degree of activity. When satiated, locomotory activity of females is significantly lower than that of males in both types of forest. These differences in locomotory activity are considered in the context of male-to-female ratios in pitfall catches. It is proposed to use the male-to-female ratio for C. hortensis, and possibly other species, as an indicator of food accessibility in forest habitat: the more males in pitfall catches in relation to females, the better the food situation in the forest},

abstract = {Cognitive ethology focuses on the study of animals under natural conditions to reveal ecologically adapted modes of learning. But biologists can more easily study what an animal learns than how it learns. For example, honeybees take repeated 'orientation' flights before becoming foragers at about three weeks of age. These flights are a prerequisite for successful homing. Little is known about these flights because orienting bees rapidly fly out of the range of human observation. Using harmonic radar, we show for the first time a striking ontogeny to honeybee orientation flights. With increased experience, bees hold trip duration constant but fly faster, so later trips cover a larger area than earlier trips. In addition, each flight is typically restricted to a narrow sector around the hive. Orientation flights provide honeybees with repeated opportunities to view the hive and landscape features from different viewpoints, suggesting that bees learn the local landscape in a progressive fashion. We also show that these changes in orientation flight are related to the number of previous flights taken instead of chronological age, suggesting a learning process adapted to changes in weather conditions, flower availability and the needs of bee colonies.},

Compared to more established methods such as recapture experiments or the use of harmonic radar systems the main advantage of this method is the possibility of using different frequencies to trace and identify several specimens in the same area and at the same time. Transmission ranges of up to 400 m make it possible to detect beetles even when dispersed over a large area. However, the use of this method is currently restricted to very large carabid species which are able to carry these still relatively heavy radio-transmitters. In 1993 and 1994, behaviour and habitat use of C. coriaceus was studied both in a larger forest area and in a small river valley with wet meadows, smaller alder forests and semi-natural brook banks. C. coriaceus showed both diurnal and nocturnal activity, but activity was more fre- quent at night. In the study area this species has a clear habitat preference for ecotone habitats like forest edges.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vine weevil (Otiorhynchus sulcatus) is a major pest of soft fruit and ornamental crops. There is an urgent need to improve control of vine weevil and in particular to provide growers with effective Integrated Pest Management-compatible controls with which to target the adult stage of this pest. One approach would be to exploit the behaviour of adult vine weevil to disseminate spores of an entomopathogenic fungus placed within the crop environment in artificial refuges. To be effective this approach requires that the weevils move through the crop environment and in doing so spread the pathogen from the artificial refuges. OBJECTIVE: Use passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to study the movement of adult vine weevil within crop environments. METHOD: A series of laboratory bioassays were completed in which the effect of attaching RFID tags using a thermoplastic or a cyanoacrylate adhesive on survival and movement, on both horizontal and vertical surfaces, of adult vine weevil was determined. An outdoor field experiment was then completed at Harper Adams University in order to test the potential of this technique for studying vine weevil movement within crop environments. RESULTS: Attaching RFID tags using the thermoplastic adhesive did not result in any weevil deaths over a 21 day period. In contrast, just over half (53{\%}) of the weevils to which the RFID tag was attached using the cyanoacrylate adhesive died over the same period. The mean of weevil horizontal movement speed was significantly slower when an RFID tag was attached using a thermoplastic (1.01 cm/s) or a cyanoacrylate (0.29 cm/s) adhesive compared with untagged weevils (1.83 cm/s). However, weevils that were tagged using the thermoplastic adhesive were significantly faster than weevils tagged using the cyanoacrylate adhesive. Mean vertical movement speed was also significantly slower when weevils were tagged using the thermoplastic adhesive (0.18 cm/s) compared with untagged weevils (0.37 cm/s). Weevils tagged using the cyanoacrylate adhesive were unable to climb vertical surfaces. In the field experiment, weevils moved away from their release points. Nine days after the start of the experiment weevils were on average 3.38m from their release points indicating a speed of movement of 0.38 m/day. The mean distance of movement from their release points did not increase further during the rest of the experimental period, but remained relatively constant at between 2.50 and 3.28 m. As such, for weevils that remained within the crop environment, there is no evidence of dispersal behaviour, with movement behaviour observed more likely to be driven by resource utilisation. However, not all weevils remained within the crop area. Indeed, 15 (38{\%}) of released weevils and/or RFID tags left the crop area, indicating possible long range dispersal by these individuals or evidence of predation of the weevils. A total of 11 (28{\%}) of the RFID tagged weevils released into the crop were recovered alive and with the tag still attached after 35 days. These weevils were estimated to have moved a distances of between 2.65 and 17.30m (average distance moved 7.50 m) during this period. These distances are likely to underestimate the distance moved by each weevil as they assume that each weevil took the most direct route between each point and did not move other than this. In total eight of the RFID-tagged weevils moved both along and between rows of strawberry grow-bags. At the start of the experiment the 11 RFID tagged weevils occupied 11 (14{\%}) of the strawberry grow-bags. If these weevils took the most direct route between each position within the crop where they were detected these weevils would have crossed, and potentially laid eggs in, 44 (58{\%}) of the grow-bags during the 35 days of the experiment. If they had taken a more indirect route the weevils could have potentially laid eggs in a higher number of the grow-bags. CONCLUSIONS: Results presented here indicate that RFID tags can be used to study the movement of vine weevil adults within crop environments. However, the weight and size of currently available tags significantly slows the movement of weevils under laboratory conditions and frequency of detection may affect estimates of actual distance moved. Despite this, the rate at which vine weevil dispersed through the strawberry crop was comparable to the speed of movement recorded previously by others when weevils were released into an urban environment. Use of RFID tags also resulted in detection rates far higher than those reported in studies by others using traditional mark-release-recapture techniques. Use of RFID tags in the present study indicates that adult vine weevil have the potential to disperse spores of a suitable entomopathogenic fungus from artificial refuges throughout the crop environment. Use of this technique could also be applied to investigate the effect of other plant protection products as well as the impact of different cropping systems on vine weevil movement and survival.},

abstract = {Female-biased size dimorphism, in which females are larger than males, is prevalent in many animals. Several hypotheses have been developed to explain this pattern of dimorphism. One of these hypotheses, the mobility hypothesis, suggests that female-biased size dimorphism arises because smaller males are favored in scramble competition for mates. Using radiotelemetry, we assessed the mobility hypothesis in the Cook Strait giant weta (Deinacrida rugosa), a species with strong female-biased size dimorphism, and tested the prediction that male traits promoting mobility (i.e., longer legs, smaller bodies) are useful in scramble competition for mates and thus promote reproductive success. Our predictions were supported: males with longer legs and smaller bodies exhibited greater mobility (daily linear displacement when not mating), and more mobile males had greater insemination success. No phenotypic traits predicted female mobility or insemination success. In species with female-biased size dimorphism, sexual selection on males is often considered to be weak compared to species in which males are large or possess weaponry. We found that male giant weta experience sexual selection intensities on par with males of a closely related harem-defending polygynous species, likely because of strong scramble competition with other males.},

abstract = {The design and operation along with verifying measurements of a harmonic radar transceiver, or tag, developed for insect tracking are presented. A short length of wire formed the antenna while a beam lead Schottky diode across a resonant loop formed the frequency doubler circuit yielding a total tag mass of less than 3 mg. Simulators using the method-of-moments for the antenna, finite-integral time-domain for the loop, and harmonic balance for the nonlinear diode element were used to predict and optimize the transceiver performance. This performance is compared to the ideal case and to measurements performed using a pulsed magnetron source within an anechoic chamber. A method for analysis of the tag is presented and used to optimize the design by creating the largest possible return signal at the second harmonic frequency for a particular incident power density. These methods were verified through measurement of tags both in isolation and mounted on insects. For excitation at 9.41 GHz the optimum tag in isolation had an antenna length of 12 mm with a loop diameter of 1 mm which yielded a harmonic cross-section of 40 mm2. For tags mounted on Colorado potato beetles, optimum performance was achieved with an 8 mm dipole fed 2 mm from the beetle attached end. A theory is developed that describes harmonic radar in a fashion similar to the conventional radar range equation but with harmonic cross-section replacing the conventional radar cross-section. This method provides a straightforward description of harmonic radar system performance as well as provides a means to describe harmonic radar tag performance.},

abstract = {This paper describes a radio-tracking study of Osmoderma eremita, a large Scarabaeid beetle, living in hollow trees. The study seems to be the first in which radio telemetry has been used with a flying insect in the field. Some 74 adult beetles were tagged with radio transmitters weighing 0.48-0.52 g and having a nominal battery life of 12-20 days. Transmissions were detected at ranges of up to 330 m, with 50-100 m obtained routinely, Contact was lost with 71{\%} of the females and 20{\%} of the males before the end of the nominal lifetime of the transmitter's battery, probably because the transmitter ceased to function. Radio telemetry proved effective in this study and gave dispersal ranges and rates that were consistent with those from a concurrent mark-recapture study in the same area. However, further development of the technique is desirable. The antennas need to be more flexible and the transmitters smaller and lighter. Nevertheless, even the current form of the technique may be suitable for studying short-range dispersal in other large-bodied flight-capable insects. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In social insects, the colony as a superorganism has a foraging rhythm aligned to the diurnal patterns of resource availability. Within this colony rhythm, the diurnal patterns of individuals are embedded, and various tasks within the colony are performed at different times by different individuals to best serve the colony as a whole. Recent studies have shown that social cues influence the traits of the circadian clock in social insects, but keeping track of the activity of individual workers is not an easy task. Here the authors use fully automatic radio-frequency identification (RFID) to analyze the circadian rhythms of bumblebee foragers (Bombus terrestris) in the normal social context of their nest. They monitored their foraging patterns under different light conditions in the laboratory, including light:dark cycles (LD) as well as constant darkness (DD) and constant light conditions (LL). Their results show that the majority of bumblebee foragers exhibit robust circadian rhythms in LD under laboratory conditions, while they show free-running rhythms both in DD and LL, with free-running periods being significantly shorter in LL conditions. The authors also found that bumblebee workers show an increased level of arrhythmic activity ("death dance") in the hours or days before their death.},

We hypothesise that flying insects like bees discover new food sources using an optimal L,vy flight searching strategy and odour-mediated anemotaxis, as well as visual cues. To study these searching patterns, foraging honeybees were trained to a scented feeder which was then removed. Two new unrewarding feeders, or 'targets', were then positioned up- and downwind of the original location of the training feeder. The subsequent flight patterns of the bees were recorded over several hundred metres using harmonic radar. We show that the flight patterns constitute an optimal L,vy flight searching strategy for the location of the training feeder, a strategy that is also optimal for the location of alternative food sources when patchily distributed. Scented targets that were positioned upwind of the original training feeder were investigated most with the numbers of investigations declining with increasing distance from the original feeder. Scented targets in downwind locations were rarely investigated and unscented targets were largely ignored, despite having the same visual appearance as the rewarding training feeder.},

abstract = {Central place foragers, such as pollinating bees, typically develop circuits (traplines) to visit multiple foraging sites in a manner that minimizes overall travel distance. Despite being taxonomically widespread, these routing behaviours remain poorly understood due to the difficulty of tracking the foraging history of animals in the wild. Here we examine how bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) develop and optimise traplines over large spatial scales by setting up an array of five artificial flowers arranged in a regular pentagon (50 m side length) and fitted with motion-sensitive video cameras to determine the sequence of visitation. Stable traplines that linked together all the flowers in an optimal sequence were typically established after a bee made 26 foraging bouts, during which time only about 20 of the 120 possible routes were  tried. Radar tracking of selected flights revealed a dramatic decrease by 80{\%} (ca. 1500 m) of the total travel distance between the first and the last foraging bout. When a flower was removed and replaced by a more distant one, bees  engaged in localised search flights, a strategy that can facilitate the discovery of a new flower and its integration into a novel optimal trapline. Based on these observations, we developed and tested an iterative improvement heuristic to  capture how bees could learn and refine their routes each time a shorter route is found. Our findings suggest that complex dynamic routing problems can be solved by small-brained animals using simple learning heuristics, without the need for a cognitive map.},

Some species have been transferred to islands or mammal-free mainland sanctuaries to establish additional populations. Radiotelemetry was used to investigate behaviour, movements and survival of adult Cook Strait giant weta (Deinacrida rugosa) immediately after translocation into Karori Sanctuary, New Zealand, to describe their initial movements, and to assess the importance of this establishment phase in relation to the long-term viability of the population. The average distance moved between consecutive daytime refuges for translocated male D. rugosa within Karori Sanctuary was significantly further than for resident weta on Matiu-Somes Island. In contrast, translocated female weta moved significantly smaller distances between consecutive daytime refuges within Karori Sanctuary than those on Matiu-Somes Island. Translocated D. rugosa travelled significantly further between consecutive daytime refuges between 19 and 45 days after release than during the first 19 days and more than 45 days of radiotracking. Deinacrida rugosa survived well following translocation and there was only limited evidence of predation despite an increased abundance of indigenous avian and reptilian predators being present, and the presence of low numbers of mice. The establishment potential of this population was not adversely affected by movements and survival of the weta immediately after translocation. It still remains to be seen if a self-sustaining population of D. rugosa develops in Karori Sanctuary but the indications are that the species is present because progeny of the translocated weta are regularly seen within Karori Sanctuary. Radiotelemetry provided valuable insights into the behaviour of adult D. rugosa and it could be appropriate for monitoring other large bodied invertebrates.},

abstract = {Warren root collar weevil, Hylobius warreni Wood, is a native, flightless insect distributed throughout the boreal forest of North America. It is an emerging problem in young plantings of lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta variety latifolia, in western Canada, where larval feeding can kill young trees by girdling the root collar. Susceptible plantings are becoming more abundant following salvage harvesting and replanting activities in the wake of an ongoing epidemic of mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae (Hopkins). Previous studies using mark-trap-recapture methods found that movement rates of adult H. warreni were elevated in areas with high numbers of dead trees, consistent with a hypothesis that the insects immigrate from stands with high mountain pine beetle-caused tree mortality to young plantings in search of live hosts. Sampling methods were necessarily biased to insects captured in traps; however, potentially missing individuals that had died, left the study area, or simply remained stationary. Here, we used harmonic radar to examine weevil movement in three different habitats: open field, forest edge, and within a forest. We were able to reliably monitor all but two of 36 insects initially released, over 96 h (4 d). Weevils released in the open field had the highest rates of movement, followed by weevils released at the forest edge, then weevils released within the forest. Movement declined with decreasing ambient air temperature. Our results suggest that weevils tend to be relatively stationary in areas of live hosts, and hence may concentrate in a suitable area once such habitat is found.},

Starved early summer beetles also travelled further than fed beetles but relied more on random movement to disperse in the habitat. Starving had little impact on the distance travelled or the path deviations of late summer beetles that are searching for overwintering site rather than hosts. * 4The increased displacement of starving beetles over fed beetles corresponded with an increased walking step and index of straightness. * 5The impact of starvation on travel distance was greater than expected from laboratory tests. * 6In conclusion, the results obtained in the present study suggest a random walking pattern to search arable land until host volatile or visual impulses trigger a more directed walk or flight.},

abstract = {The development of insecticides requires valid risk assessment procedures to avoid causing harm to beneficial insects and especially to pollinators such as the honeybee Apis mellifera. In addition to testing according to current guidelines designed to detect bee mortality, tests are needed to determine possible sublethal effects interfering with the animal's vitality and behavioral performance. Several methods have been used to detect sublethal effects of different insecticides under laboratory conditions using olfactory conditioning. Furthermore, studies have been conducted on the influence insecticides have on foraging activity and homing ability which require time-consuming visual observation. We tested an experimental design using the radiofrequency identification (RFID) method to monitor the influence of sublethal doses of insecticides on individual honeybee foragers on an automated basis. With electronic readers positioned at the hive entrance and at an artificial food source, we obtained quantifiable data on honeybee foraging behavior. This enabled us to efficiently retrieve detailed information on flight parameters. We compared several groups of bees, fed simultaneously with different dosages of a tested substance. With this experimental approach we monitored the acute effects of sublethal doses of the neonicotinoids imidacloprid (0.15-6 ng/bee) and clothianidin (0.05-2 ng/bee) under field-like circumstances. At field-relevant doses for nectar and pollen no adverse effects were observed for either substance. Both substances led to a significant reduction of foraging activity and to longer foraging flights at doses of ≥0.5 ng/bee (clothianidin) and ≥1.5 ng/bee (imidacloprid) during the first three hours after treatment. This study demonstrates that the RFID-method is an effective way to record short-term alterations in foraging activity after insecticides have been administered once, orally, to individual bees. We contribute further information on the understanding of how honeybees are affected by sublethal doses of insecticides.},

abstract = {Three neonicotinoids, imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiacloprid, agonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the central brain of insects, were applied at non-lethal doses in order to test their effects on honeybee navigation. A catch-and-release experimental design was applied in which feeder trained bees were caught when arriving at the feeder, treated with one of the neonicotinoids, and released 1.5 hours later at a remote site. The flight paths of individual bees were tracked with harmonic radar. The initial flight phase controlled by the recently acquired navigation memory (vector memory) was less compromised than the second phase that leads the animal back to the hive (homing flight). The rate of successful return was significantly lower in treated bees, the probability of a correct turn at a salient landscape structure was reduced, and less directed flights during homing flights were performed. Since the homing phase in catch-and-release experiments documents the ability of a foraging honeybee to activate a remote memory acquired during its exploratory orientation flights, we conclude that non-lethal doses of the three neonicotinoids tested either block the retrieval of exploratory navigation memory or alter this form of navigation memory. These findings are discussed in the context of the application of neonicotinoids in plant protection.},

abstract = {Understanding strategies used by animals to explore their landscape is essential to predict how they exploit patchy resources, and consequently how they are likely to respond to changes in resource distribution. Social bees provide a good model for this and, whilst there are published descriptions of their behaviour on initial learning flights close to the colony, it is still unclear how bees find floral resources over hundreds of metres and how these flights become directed foraging trips. We investigated the spatial ecology of exploration by radar tracking bumblebees, and comparing the flight trajectories of bees with differing experience. The bees left the colony within a day or two of eclosion and flew in complex loops of ever-increasing size around the colony, exhibiting L{\'{e}}vy-flight characteristics constituting an optimal searching strategy. This mathematical pattern can be used to predict how animals exploring individually might exploit a patchy landscape. The bees' groundspeed, maximum displacement from the nest and total distance travelled on a trip increased significantly with experience. More experienced bees flew direct paths, predominantly flying upwind on their outward trips although forage was available in all directions. The flights differed from those of nave honeybees: they occurred at an earlier age, showed more complex looping, and resulted in earlier returns of pollen to the colony. In summary bumblebees learn to find home and food rapidly, though phases of orientation, learning and searching were not easily separable, suggesting some multi-tasking.},

A design consisting of a 6-cm-long 0.10-mm-thick silver-plated copper monopole on the anode terminal of a three-contact Schottky barrier diode attached with Gorilla super glue provided a compromise between unimpaired movement and tracking range, adding an additional 8{\%} to the weight of the stink bug while not significantly (P {\textgreater} 0.05) reducing walking or flying mobility in the laboratory. Recovery of tagged stink bugs in cotton, Gossypium hirsutum (L.), and fallow fields ranged from 10 to 75{\%} after 24 h, whereas marked stink bugs were recovered at rates of 0-35{\%} by using sweep net or drop cloth sampling. The distance dispersed in the field was not impacted (P {\textgreater} 0.05) by crop, tagged status, or gender of the insect.

We confirmed that alien queen take-overs are common within this species, and demonstrated that mated queens actively seek out colonies without a queen to reproduce in. Furthermore, we found that queens only penetrate their target colonies in the evening, when guarding efficiency is significantly reduced.

(1) Short-range flights are likely to be related to learning the specific features of the hive's immediate surroundings, and were performed significantly more frequently under unfavourable weather conditions. (2) The duration of long-range orientation flights declined from the first to the fourth flight because the bees spent less time inspecting the immediate surroundings of the hive. (3) Parts of single orientation flights were guided by extended parallel landscape structures on the ground. (4) During consecutive orientation flights bees explored novel sectors of the terrain. (5) Foraging flights performed after orientation flights covered greater distances and may involve a sector of the terrain not explored before, indicating that the acquired visual information plus path integration is sufficient for successful homing even from unfamiliar areas. (6) Exploration may be mixed with foraging flights after the initial orientation flights, sometimes leading to extremely long and elaborate flights. The latter are interpreted as being performed by scout bees. The results are interpreted within the frame of the psychology of exploratory behaviour in animals.},

abstract = {Estimating demographic parameters in rare species is challenging because of the low number of individuals and their cryptic behaviour. One way to address this challenge is to gather data from several regions or years through mark-release-recapture (MRR) and radio-tracking monitoring. However, the comparison of demographic estimates obtained using these methods has rarely been investigated. Using 5 years of intensive MRR and radio-tracking surveys of an elusive and endangered saproxylic insect, the hermit beetle (Osmoderma eremita), in two regions of France, we aimed to estimate population size at the adult stage for each sex separately and to assess differences in demographic parameter estimates between survey methods. We found that males were approximately three times more likely to be recaptured than females. Taking this into account, we determined that the sex ratio was male-biased in almost all populations, except in Malus trees, where it was female-biased. Temporal fluctuations of sex ratios were also detected in one region. The radio-tracking transmitter (450 mg) allowed only the largest individuals ({\textgreater}2 g) to be targeted. However, we found that, among non-equipped individuals, the larger males survived better than the smaller males. We also confirmed that transmitter-equipped individuals survived approximately 25 {\%} better than non-equipped individuals. Extrapolating the estimates from radio-tracking surveys to the population scale may result in overly optimistic population projections. Our results revealed large temporal and spatial variations in population size and sex ratios. This knowledge is crucial for predicting the persistence of small populations in fragmented landscapes. This study also questioned the representativeness of radio-tracking surveys for insect species in estimating demographic parameters at the population scale.},

abstract = {1. Insect pollination is a vital ecosystem service that maintains biodiversity and sustains agri- cultural crop yields. Social bees are essential insect pollinators, so it is concerning that their populations are in global decline. 2. Although pesticide exposure has been implicated as a possible cause for bee declines, we currently have a limited understanding of the risk these chemicals pose. Whilst environmental exposure to pesticides typically has non-lethal effects on individual bees, recent reports suggest that sublethal exposure can affect important behavioural traits such as foraging. However, at present, we know comparatively little about how natural foraging behaviour is impaired and the relative impacts of acute and chronic effects. 3. Using Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging technology, we examined how the day-to-day foraging patterns of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were affected when exposed to either a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and/or a pyrethroid (k-cyhalothrin) independently and in combination over a four-week period. This is the first study to provide data on the impacts of combined and individual pesticide exposure on the temporal dynamics of foraging behaviour in the field over a prolonged period of time. 4. Our results show that neonicotinoid exposure has both acute and chronic effects on overall foraging activity. Whilst foragers from control colonies improved their pollen foraging perfor- mance as they gained experience, the performance of bees exposed to imidacloprid became worse: chronic behavioural impairment. We also found evidence, suggesting that pesticide exposure can change forager preferences for the flower types from which they collect pollen. 5. Our findings highlight the importance of considering prolonged exposure (which happens in the field) when assessing the risk that pesticides pose to bees. The effects of chronic pesticide exposure could have serious detrimental consequences for both colony survival and also the pollination services provided by these essential insect pollinators.

abstract = {The bark scorpion, Centruroides sculpturatus Ewing, is a nocturnal, cryptic, nonburrowing, mobile species that is common in urban landscapes spanning the desert southwest. Bark scorpions are often found in dense localized populations in cities, but the question of whether this is because the species is metabolically movement limited or choose to aggregate has not been addressed. Field observations lead us to believe that the scorpions move very little. Their ability to move is tested here. A circular pacing ring was constructed to observe the distance individuals could move in 2 h under both dark and light conditions. Observations under light motivate the arthropods to move, and significantly greater distances were observed in light trials, the maximum travel distance being 104.37 m, while the maximum distance in dark trials was 14.63 m. To monitor movement in the field, telemetry tags were used to mark female and male scorpions over 21 d during which relocation distances were recorded daily. Additionally, 12-h and 6-h overnight observational periods took place during which, scorpion movements were recorded hourly. Overall, it was found that scorpions moved significantly more in the pacing ring than in the field, indicating that field individuals are not moving at their maximum potential. Movement limitation does not explain their distribution pattern. In both the pacing ring and field, gender and pregnancy status had significant influence on distances moved. We conclude that C. sculpturatus is capable of much greater movement than is typically observed in the field.},

abstract = {Dispersal ability is known to limit the colonization by many fenland species onto restored habitat but factors determining colonization by wetland invertebrates onto restored fenland have not been previously examined. We used mark-release-recapture and harmonic radar tracking coupled with genetic analysis (ISSR-PCR, inter-simple sequence repeat—polymerase chain reaction) to assess the population structure and colonization of a brachypterous wetland carabid (Carabus granulatus) onto restored fenland. The first two methods were used to determine the dispersal rate of C. granulatus in the absence of barriers, while the genetic analysis was used to examine whether populations were separated by either distance or the water channels and drainage ditches that intersect fenland landscapes. Mark-release-recapture and harmonic radar tracking indicated that the most active 6{\%} of individuals could travel over 25 m in a day and individuals found to be traveling these distances remained atypically active throughout the season. Thus, C. granulatus can disperse at a rate great enough to colonize all areas of restored fenland in the study site within 1 year in the absence of barriers. We found no evidence of genetically distinct sub-populations of C. granulatus showing that distance and water barriers did not limit the movement of individuals from potential source populations to the restored habitat. This research indicates that where fenland is created with nearby established fenland, colonization opportunities should not be considered a limiting factor to colonization by wetland carabids, even where waterways divide sites.},

To maximize the capacity of this technology, it is necessary that radar tags must be securely attached to insects and that the tags remain functional when subjected to mechanical stress. In this study, a series of experiments was carried out to test an improved harmonic radar tag designed to be more resistant to mechanical stresses and to establish that a portable harmonic radar system can effectively detect adult Halyomorpha halys St{\aa}l (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) on various structures in different landscapes. The functional resistance of radar tags to ∼1-m free falls on a hard surface was improved significantly by reinforcing the adhesive bond between the radar transponder and the radar wire by application of cyanoacrylate glue. This measure did not affect the detectability of radar tags, and it significantly increased the resistance of radar tags against random mechanical impact...},

abstract = {Exploration is an elementary and fundamental form of learning about the structure of the world [1–3]. Little is known about what exactly is learned when an animal seeks to become familiar with the environment. Navigating animals explore the environment for safe return to an important place (e.g., a nest site) and to travel between places [4]. Flying central-place foragers like honeybees (Apis mellifera) extend their exploration into distances from which the features of the nest cannot be directly perceived [5–10]. Bees perform short-range and long-range orientations flights. Short-range flights are performed in the immediate surroundings of the hive and occur more frequently under unfavorable weather conditions, whereas long-range flights lead the bees into different sectors of the surrounding environment [11]. Applying harmonic radar technology for flight tracking, we address the question of whether bees learn landscape features during their first short-range or long-range orientation flight. The homing flights of single bees were compared after they were displaced to areas explored or not explored during the orientation flight. Bees learn the landscape features during the first orientation flight since they returned faster and along straighter flights from explored areas as compared to unexplored areas. We excluded a range of possible factors that might have guided bees back to the hive based on egocentric navigation strategies (path integration, beacon orientation, and pattern matching of the skyline). We conclude that bees localize themselves according to learned ground structures and their spatial relations to the hive.},

Results confirmed the long residency time on the host plant and showed that close connection of the plant to neighboring plants hastened dispersal between plants. Tracking walking CPB for over 6 h in small potato plots revealed that all types of mixed borders tested (potato/bare ground, potato/timothy and potato/woodland) acted as a strong barrier and retained beetles within the patch. In another experiment in potato patches surrounded by bare ground borders, tracked walking CPB displayed similar behaviour for up to four days. The distribution of turning angles in the CPB walking paths was not uniform and corresponded to beetles following the edge rows of potato patches in response to the crop border barrier or reversing their direction as they reached the end of a row and therefore a border. Patch size had no or little effect on beetle retention in the patch. The relative distribution of counts of tagged beetles detected among small (16 m2), medium (64 m2) and large size (256 m2) patches of potato four days after initial release remained similar to that of numbers released. Even though mixed crop borders were a strong barrier to walking CPB emigrating from potato patches, the departure rate of beetles over time was high. Results suggest that the effect of mixed borders is largely limited to dispersal by walking and does not apply to beetles leaving host patches by flight. The manipulation of crop borders and patch size seem to have limited potential for the management of CPB emigrating from potato fields.},

Recent studies however have suggested that exposure to systemic neonicotinoid insecticides in flowering crops has sub-lethal effects on the bumblebee workforce, and hence in reducing queen production. The mechanism behind reduced nest performance, however, remains unclear. Here we use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to test whether exposure to a low, field realistic dose (0.7 ppb in sugar water and 6 ppb in pollen) of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, reduces worker foraging efficiency. Whilst the nectar foraging efficiency of bees treated with imidacloprid was not significantly different than that of control bees, treated bees brought back pollen less often than control bees (40 {\%} of trips vs 63 {\%} trips, respectively) and, where pollen was collected, treated bees brought back 31 {\%} less pollen per hour than controls. This study demonstrates that field-realistic doses of these pesticides substantially impacts on foraging ability of bumblebee workers when collecting pollen, and we suggest that this provides a causal mechanism behind reduced queen production in imidacloprid exposed colonies.},

abstract = {L{\'{e}}vy flights are scale-free (fractal) search patterns found in a wide range of animals. They can be an advantageous strategy promoting high encounter rates with rare cues that may indicate prey items, mating partners or navigational landmarks. The robustness of this behavioural strategy to ubiquitous threats to animal performance, such as pathogens, remains poorly understood. Using honeybees radar-tracked during their orientation flights in a novel landscape, we assess for the first time how two emerging infectious diseases (Nosema sp. and the Varroa-associated Deformed wing virus (DWV)) affect bees' behavioural performance and search strategy. Nosema infection, unlike DWV, affected the spatial scale of orientation flights, causing significantly shorter and more compact flights. However, in stark contrast to disease-dependent temporal fractals, we find the same prevalence of optimal L{\'{e}}vy flight characteristics ($\mu$ ≈ 2) in both healthy and infected bees. We discuss the ecological and evolutionary implications of these surprising insights, arguing that L{\'{e}}vy search patterns are an emergent property of fundamental characteristics of neuronal and sensory components of the decision-making process, making them robust against diverse physiological effects of pathogen infection and possibly other stressors.},

abstract = {1. The ability to forage and return home is essential to the success of bees as both foragers and pollinators. Pesticide exposure may cause behavioural changes that interfere with these processes, with consequences for colony persistence and delivery of pollination services. 2. We investigated the impact of chronic exposure (5–43 days) to field-realistic levels of a neonicotinoid insecticide (2?4 ppb thiamethoxam) on foraging ability, homing success and colony size using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology in free-flying bumblebee colonies. 3. Individual foragers from pesticide-exposed colonies carried out longer foraging bouts than untreated controls (68 vs. 55 min). Pesticide-exposed bees also brought back pollen less fre- quently than controls indicating reduced foraging performance. 4. A higher proportion of bees from pesticide-exposed colonies returned when released 1 km from their nests; this is potentially related to increased orientation experience during longer foraging bouts. We measured no impact of pesticide exposure on homing ability for bees released from 2 km, or when data were analysed overall. 5. Despite a trend for control colonies to produce more new workers earlier, we found no overall impacts of pesticide exposure on whole colony size. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that field-realistic neonicotinoid exposure can have impacts on both foraging ability and homing success of bumblebees, with implications for the success of bumblebee colonies in agricultural landscapes and their ability to deliver crucial pollination services. Pesticide risk assessments should include bee species other than honeybees and assess a range of behaviours to elucidate the impact of sublethal effects. This has relevance for reviews of neonicotinoid risk assessment and usage policy world-wide.},

abstract = {Honey bees (Apis mellifera) host a wide range of parasites, some being known contributors towards dramatic colony losses as reported over recent years. To counter parasitic threats, honey bees possess effective immune systems. Because immune responses are predicted to cause substantial physiological costs for infected individuals, they are expected to trade off with other life history traits that ultimately affect the performance and fitness of the entire colony. Here, we tested whether the initial onset of an infection negatively impacts the flight behaviour of honey bee workers, which is an energetically demanding behaviour and a key component of foraging activities. To do this, we infected workers with the widespread fungal pathogen Nosema apis, which is recognised and killed by the honey bee immune system. We compared their survival and flight behaviour with non-infected individuals from the same cohort and colony using radio frequency identification tags (RFID). We found that over a time frame of four days post infection, Nosema did not increase mortality but workers quickly altered their flight behaviour and performed more flights of shorter duration. We conclude that parasitic infections influence foraging activities, which could reduce foraging ranges of colonies and impact their ability to provide pollination services. The lifestyle of social hymenopteran insects, as found in all ants and some bees and wasps, results in related individuals living in close proximity to each other inside the colony, which offers parasites highly favourable con-ditions to spread and multiply 1 . Social insects are indeed known to host a wide range of different parasites such as viruses 2,3 , bacteria 1,4 fungi 5,6 , protozoa 7,8 , as well as arachnids 9,10 or other insects 11,12 that can pose substantial threats to these societies. In the case of the honey bee (Apis mellifera), their impact has been identified as a main contributing factor towards the massive losses as observed in some managed and wild honey bee populations 10,12 . Social insects are not defenceless however, and their immune systems consist of several adaptations to detect and combat pathogens 1,13 such as social immunity, which includes a number of behaviours that reduce the spread of pathogens including grooming of infected relatives, or hygienic behaviour to remove parasitised brood from the colony 13–15 . Parasitised honey bee workers are known to start foraging at a younger age to reduce the risk of spreading disease to their nestmates 16–18 . Social insects also possess individual-based innate immune systems, and the individual's ability to combat parasites is of central importance for colony fitness 19 . These consist of a cellular response to combat large parasites (through processes such as encapsulation and melanisation), as well as a humoral response mediated by antimicrobial peptides, proteins and other cytotoxic compounds 20–22 . The activation and use of such defence mechanisms is complex 23 and assumed to be costly and to trade-off with other life history traits 24 . For example, immune activation reduces the survival of infected workers in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris 25 and affects reproduction in honey bees by diverting their energy stores towards immunity 26,27 . Trade-offs between immunity and other life history traits seem also present in queens of the leaf cutting ant Atta colombica, where the capacity to activate the immune system during colony foundation is inversely proportional to the number of sperm stored during matings 28 . If parasitic infections spread to an increasing number of colony members and impact their task performance such as brood care, grooming or foraging, their effects eventually become visible at the colony level 1,20 . In the most extreme case, they can result in the collapse and death of the entire colony, a phenomenon that has been frequently reported in honey bees and therefore received growing interest over recent years 19 . However, how parasite-driven stress acting at the individual level eventually translates into the collapse of an entire colony remains to be studied in detail. Here, we quantified the initial impact of an infection on cellular immune response and flight behaviour of a cohort of same-aged honey bee workers. Our experimental setup covered the time frame of establishment of a primary infection and the consequent physiological and behavioural responses of the host. We predicted that the response of the immune system to infection is costly, which bees compensate for by reducing the duration or frequency of their foraging trips. To do this we took workers with an age of 18–19 days, which coincides with the start of their foraging activities 29},

abstract = {Insect pollinators such as bumblebees play a vital role in many ecosystems, so it is impor- tant to understand their foraging movements on a landscape scale. We used harmonic radar to record the natural foraging behaviour of Bombus terrestris audax workers over their entire foraging career. Every flight ever made outside the nest by four foragers was recorded. Our data reveal where the bees flew and how their behaviour changed with expe- rience, at an unprecedented level of detail. We identified how each bee's flights fit into two categories—which we named exploration and exploitation flights—examining the differ- ences between the two types of flight and how their occurrence changed over the course of the bees' foraging careers. Exploitation of learned resources takes place during efficient, straight trips, usually to a single foraging location, and is seldom combined with exploration of other areas. Exploration of the landscape typically occurs in the first few flights made by each bee, but our data show that further exploration flights can bemade throughout the bee's foraging career. Bees showed striking levels of variation in how they explored their environment, their fidelity to particular patches, ratio of exploration to exploitation, duration and frequency of their foraging bouts. One bee developed a straight route to a forage patch within four flights and followed this route exclusively for six days before abandoning it entirely for a closer location; this second location had not been visited since her first explor- atory flight nine days prior. Another bee made only rare exploitation flights and continued to explore widely throughout its life; two other bees showedmore frequent switches between exploration and exploitation. Our data shed light on the way bumblebees balance explora- tion of the environment with exploitation of resources and reveal extreme levels of variation between individuals. Introduction},

We report the first successful use of radio telemetry to track flight distances and space use of a flying moth. Our study was carried out using 11 tagged moths released on the Maguelone Peninsula in southern France. Although the males were successfully tracked within a restricted area, estimated at 4 ha, most of the tagged females immediately flew distances over 500 m, disappearing beyond the maximum detection range of the 30 ha study area. Flights for mating, resting and, likely, oviposition covered distances of 11.6 m to 224 m in males and 16.8 m to {\textgreater}500 m in females. We found evidence that both sexes are active during the warmer temperatures of the day. In contrast, the moths were inactive when the relative humidity was high. Moreover, the P. archon moths do not seem to reside on the host palm trees. Our data show a high mobility of females, which may be responsible for the spread of the first recorded Castniidae in France by laying eggs far from the palm trees where they emerged.},

abstract = {Halyomorpha halys (St{\aa}l), the brown marmorated stink bug, is an invasive, polyphagous insect that causes serious economic injury in particular to specialty crops in the United States. Growers have been forced to respond by increasing the frequency of broad-spectrum insecticide (e.g., neonicotinoid, pyrethroid, and carbamate) applications. One strategy to reduce reliance on insecticides is known as “attract-and-kill” whereby the targeted insect is attracted to a spatially precise location to be eliminated by a killing agent such as an insecticide. This approach can substantially reduce the amount of insecticide used by sparing alternate row middle or whole block sprays. For apple orchards, we propose baiting select border row trees with the H. halys aggregation pheromone and synergist and subsequently treating these baited trees with effective insecticides to kill H. halys throughout the growing season. To evaluate the behavioral basis of this approach, we conducted orchard trials with black pyramid traps, harmonic radar, and trials using baited apple trees sprayed weekly to quantify H. halys arrestment area, retention time, adult and nymph annihilation, and fruit injury in and near these attract-and-kill sites. The arrestment area for H. halys was confined to a 2.5 m radius around the pheromone- and pheromone synergist-baited trap regardless of pheromone dose (84 or 840 mg), while the retention capacity of adults was significantly increased by pairing the aggregation pheromone and synergist with a fruiting host plant compared with non-host sites. Damage to fruit harvested from baited attract-and-kill trees was high, but minimal in surrounding unbaited neighboring apple trees. Our results suggest attract-and-kill may be an effective strategy for managing H. halys season-long.},

abstract = {The spotted lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula (White) (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae), has recently emerged as an invasive pest in the United States, threatening the grape and tree fruit industries. The biology of L. delicatula is poorly known. This invasive pest has rapidly spread and established itself in new regions (e.g., South Korea), taking advantage of a wide range of host plants, but virtually no studies of the dispersal capacity and patterns of the species have been published. Harmonic radar tracking provides a new tool to study the dispersal of small animals such as insects in natural field settings. In this study, we discuss procedures that allow secure attachment of harmonic radar tags on the 4th instar nymphs of L. delicatula. The adhesive bond strength between the radar tag and the nymph was sufficiently great for operational use, yielding 431.10 +/- 43.37 g forces (mean +/- SE). Variations in L. delicatula body size of did not affect the adhesive bond strength. Neither horizontal mobility nor vertical climbing ability of L. delicatula was affected by radar tagging when compared with untagged controls. Also, there was no significant difference in the jumping ability of radar-tagged and untagged insects. Finally, radar tagging did not affect the survivorship of L. delicatula over a 3 d test period. The results of this study indicate that the harmonic radar system can be applied successfully to 4th instars of L. delicatula without changing their mobility and survivorship. This technology facilitates study of the dispersal capacity and behavior of this invasive species under natural field conditions, and this information can serve as a basis for the development of effective monitoring and management strategies.},

abstract = {Imidacloprid (IMI), a neonicotinoid used for its high selective toxicity to insects, is one of the most commonly used pesticides. However, its effect on beneficial insects such as the honeybee Apis mellifera L is still controversial. As young adult workers perform in-hive duties that are crucial for colony maintenance and survival, we aimed to assess the effect of sublethal IMI doses on honeybee behaviour during this period. Also, because this insecticide acts as a cholinergic-nicotinic agonist and these pathways take part in insect learning and memory processes; we used IMI to assess their role and the changes they suffer along early adulthood. We focused on appetitive behaviours based on the proboscis extension response. Laboratory reared adults of 2 to 10 days of age were exposed to sublethal IMI doses (0.25 or 0.50ng) administered orally or topically prior to behavioural assessment. Modification of gustatory responsiveness and impairment of learning and memory were found as a result of IMI exposure. These outcomes differed depending on age of evaluation, type of exposure and IMI dose, being the youngest bees more sensitive and the highest oral dose more toxic. Altogether, these results imply that IMI administered at levels found in agroecosystems can reduce sensitivity to reward and impair associative learning in young honeybees. Therefore, once a nectar inflow with IMI traces is distributed within the hive, it could impair in-door duties with negative consequences on colony performance.},

abstract = {Animals that live together in groups often face difficult choices, such as which food resource to exploit, or which direction to flee in response to a predator. When there are costs associated with deadlock or group fragmentation, it is essential that the group achieves a consensus decision. Here, we study consensus formation in emigrating ant colonies faced with a binary choice between two identical nest-sites. By individually tagging each ant with a unique radio-frequency identification microchip, and then recording all ant-to-ant 'tandem runs'-stereotyped physical interactions that communicate information about potential nest-sites-we assembled the networks that trace the spread of consensus throughout the colony. Through repeated emigrations, we show that both the order in which these networks are assembled and the position of each individual within them are consistent from emigration to emigration. We demonstrate that the formation of the consensus is delegated to an influential but exclusive minority of highly active individuals-an 'oligarchy'-which is further divided into two subgroups, each specialized upon a different tandem running role. Finally, we show that communication primarily occurs between subgroups not within them, and further, that such between-group communication is more efficient than within-group communication.},

One of the most straightforward methods to provide direct measures of animal dispersal is telemetry. Despite its merits, this method has rarely been used for saproxylic beetles. In this study, we examined dispersal ability of the Great Capricorn beetle Cerambyx cerdo (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), an endangered veteran oak specialist. Using a radio-tracking approach, we tracked 26 individuals (15 males and 11 females) equipped with transmitters for 4 to 17 days (median 14). We observed no disturbance of movements or flight problems due to the transmitter. The daily probability of movement by an individual was 64{\%} and the longest displacement in one day was 1498 m for males and 1080 m for females. For 15{\%} of all individuals, the tracking distance covered was {\textgreater}2200 m. Our results indicate that C. cerdo individuals often move among trees over an area of several kilometres. Such findings contrast with previous results based on a mark-recapture study. The relatively high mobility of the species should be reflected in strategies aiming at its conservation.},

The use of radio-telemetry allowed to detect the oviposition sites and to study the first part of the adult life, when they resulted to be more active. Males were more prone to disperse than females but the home range size did not differ between the sexes.

abstract = {1 Although much work has focused on understanding how the invasive brown mar-morated stink bug, or Halyomorpha halys, responds to pheromonal stimuli, very little research has explored the response of H. halys to plant volatiles and other host stimuli. The present study aimed to determine (i) whether more acceptable, less acceptable or unacceptable host plants augmented with plant volatile mixes and/or pheromone can enhance the retention capacity of plants for H. halys in the field and (ii) whether plant volatiles [apple, peach or green leaf volatile (GLV) mixtures] can increase attraction to pheromone-baited pyramid traps. 2 The presence of the H. halys pheromone was the primary factor in increasing the retention capacity of tagged, released adults to host plants, although plant volatile mixtures added a small increase in retention. Plant species helped to modulate the effectiveness of both the pheromone and additional plant volatiles in retaining individuals. Plant volatiles did not increase attraction of adults to baited pyramid traps and may have inhibited the attraction of nymphs. 3 Overall, the results of the present study suggest that host plant stimuli, construed broadly, are important for the foraging decisions of H. halys, although further research is needed to identify the most effective stimuli.},

This is especially true for arboreal insects inhabiting old-growth forests, whose habits are scarcely known and rely on many anecdotal data, such as the stag beetle Lucanus cervus (Linnaeus, 1758). In order to gather information on daily activity and behaviour of this species, a radio-telemetry study was conducted in a relict broadleaf forest surrounded by intensively cultivated land in northern Italy. During 2014 and 2015, from May to July, 55 stag beetles (34 males, 21 females) were radio-tagged. Most of them were caught with the aid of an entomological hand net, but nine of them were captured by emergence traps set up on deadwood. Visual contact analysis confirmed that stag beetle males were less elusive than females. Males were more frequently radio-tracked in flight, females mostly underground and in proximity of deadwood. Males were mostly observed flying at sunset, and resting or walking on standing trees during the day. The combination of air temperature and humidity determined the optimal weather conditions for male flights (temperature range: 20.7–26 °C, humidity range: 65.5–78.3{\%}). Flying at sunset, mostly performed by males, significantly increased the detectability of the species and supported the selection of the ‘transect walk at dusk' as the best monitoring method for the stag beetle. {\textcopyright} 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract = {Animals that visit multiple foraging sites face a problem, analogous to the Travelling Salesman Problem, of finding an efficient route. We explored bumblebees' route development on an array of five artificial flowers in which minimising travel distances between individual feeders conflicted with minimising overall distance. No previous study of bee spatial navigation has been able to follow animals' movement during learning; we tracked bumblebee foragers continuously, using harmonic radar, and examined the process of route formation in detail for a small number of selected individuals. On our array, bees did not settle on visit sequences that gave the shortest overall path, but prioritised movements to nearby feeders. Nonetheless, flight distance and duration reduced with experience. This increased efficiency was attributable mainly to experienced bees reducing exploration beyond the feeder array and flights becoming straighter with experience, rather than improvements in the sequence of feeder visits. Flight paths of all legs of a flight stabilised at similar rates, whereas the first few feeder visits became fixed early while bees continued to experiment with the order of later visits. Stabilising early sections of a route and prioritising travel between nearby destinations may reduce the search space, allowing rapid adoption of efficient routes.},

Visual sampling demonstrated no significant differences in H.halys densities across crops, whereas dislodging stink bugs to collect for protein analysis revealed ca. 4x more bugs in the trap crop plants than in the peppers. In total 145 H.halys were collected and of these 6{\%} were doubly marked with proteins, demonstrating that minimal movement occurred between the two planting systems. Tracking tagged H.halys with harmonic radar revealed that the trap crop retained adult H.halys within the plots 1.5x longer and reduced their movement by nearly half compared with bugs released in the pepper cash crop. The data suggest the trap crop of sunflower plus sorghum has the potential to attract and arrest the invasive H.halys, demonstrating that trap cropping may operate as an effective management tool.},

of conservation concern throughout most of its range. Yet little is
known about the habitat use of either sex away from the breeding stream
hampering conservation strategies. In this study we use miniaturized
radio transmitters to investigate the habitat use and home range of
individual males and a female Tiger Spiketail in New Jersey. This is the
first and only radio-telemetry for this species. We also provide
recommendations for habitat protection and conservation. Our studies
demonstrate that this species is critically dependent upon mature forest
and the high quality, perennial headwater streams that run through them.
These habitats are particularly sensitive to disturbance. Except when
patrolling and ovipositing, both sexes are in the canopy above the
breeding stream and in the adjacent mature forest, indicating the
inseparable linkage between the aquatic and forested terrestrial habitat
for this species. Our observations also suggest that C. erronea occurs
in a metapopulation of nearby streams in our study area. Conservation of
this species may therefore require forest protection far beyond the
breeding stream. In New Jersey, and in other places throughout the
range, there are many potential pressures on these habitats and current
regulatory protections are not likely suitable. These same habitats may
also be important for other Odonate species of conservation concern
suggesting that protection of C. erronea may benefit a suite of species.

First posted online on 23 December 2016 as doi:10.1242/jeb.149823 ABSTRACT Amplypygids, or whip spiders, are nocturnal, predatory arthropods that display a robust ability to navigate to their home refuge. Prior field observations and displacement studies in amblypygids demonstrated an ability to home from distances as far away as 10 meters. In the current study, micro-transmitters were used to take morning position fixes of individual Paraphrynus laevifrons following an experimental displacement of 10 m from their home refuge. The intent was to assess the relative importance of vision compared to sensory input acquired from the antenniform legs for navigation as well as other aspects of their spatial behavior. Displaced individuals were randomly assigned to three treatment groups : (i) control individuals-C, (ii) vision deprived individuals-VD, and (iii) individuals with sensory input from the tips of their antenniform legs compromised-AD. C and VD subjects were generally sucessful in returning home, and the direction of their movement on the first night following displacement was homeward oriented. By contrast, AD subjects experienced a complete loss of navigational ability, and movement on their first night indicated no hint of homeward orientation. The data strongly support the hypothesis that sensory input from the tips of the antenniform legs is necessary for successful homing in amblypygids following displacement to an unfamiliar location, and we hypothesize an essential role of olfaction for this navigational ability.},

abstract = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros L., is a serious pest of coconut and other palms throughout Southeast Asia and on several Pacific Islands. Adults damage and sometimes kill palms when they bore into the crown to feed. In contrast, larvae feed only on dead plant material at breeding sites. Typically, coconut rhinoceros beetle populations are controlled with a combination of biocontrol, pheromone traps, and breeding site removal. A field trial was performed at two locations on Guam to test the feasibility of using the Judas technique, releasing radio-tagged adults to discover cryptic breeding sites, for potential coconut rhinoceros beetle control. Of 33 radio-tagged beetles that were released, 19 were successfully tracked to landing sites, 11 of which were considered to be active or potential breeding sites, in five different microhabitats. The remaining 14 beetles were lost when they flew beyond the range of receivers. Only one of the radio-tagged beetles was caught in the numerous pheromone traps present at the release sites. Percent emergence weight ({\%}EW, ratio of current/emergence weight) varied significantly by the microhabitat to which coconut rhinoceros beetles were tracked. When microhabitats were further grouped, the difference in mean {\%}EW between the arboreal (7462{\%}) and the soil-associated (8263{\%}) groups were found to be highly significant. The {\%}EW for coconut rhinoceros beetles that were successfully located (7862{\%}) and those that were lost (7262{\%}) also differed significantly. Radiotracking coconut rhinoceros beetles shows promise as a method to identify cryptic breeding sites, which could then be treated, removed, or destroyed. {\textcopyright} The Authors 2017.

abstract = {The European stag beetle, Lucanus cervus, is a flagship species for biodiversity conservation of old-growth forests and is protected under the Habitats Directive. Although it has been the focus of active research in the last two decades, many aspects of its ecology and habitat requirements for the larvae remain poorly known, particularly to what extent certain factors limit larval development. The objectives of this preliminary work were: (1) to explore the feasibility of a non-invasive method for detecting oviposition sites; (2) to attempt the characterisation of above-ground ecological factors recorded in the oviposition sites and (3) to quantify the number of traps and operators needed for obtaining a number of beetles suitable for statistical analysis. In 2014, twelve females were followed by means of radio-telemetry to detect potential oviposition sites in a relict broadleaf forest of northern Italy. In 2015, emergence traps were set in nine sites selected from the 21 sites where females were recorded digging deeply in the soil near to dead wood during the previous year. Traps were checked during the 2015 and 2016 flight seasons. Overall, 15 stag beetles were detected (8 males and 7 females) from five emergence trap sites which were therefore regarded as real oviposition sites. All oviposition sites were characterised in terms of typology of dead wood, tree species, canopy openness, trunk diameter, dead wood volume, decomposition stage (five classes) and wood hardness (four classes). All the detected emergence sites belonged to the genus Quercus, two being from the allochthonous Q. rubra, but no preferences for a dead wood species nor for a typology were shown and a broad variation was apparent for all the considered variables. The mean values of canopy openness, diameter, dead wood volume, decay status and wood hardness were 2.54{\%}, 51cm, 4.92m3, 3 and 3.4 respectively. These data suggested an important heterogeneity in the oviposition sites selection. Although this method (telemetry + emergence traps) provided substantial aid to finding newly emerged beetles, it required a large amount of fieldwork effort, both in terms of time and man-hours. The advantage of the method is its low degree of invasion while its drawback is the amount of effort needed. Calculations were made to assess the minimum number of operators and traps needed to gather a number of data suitable for statistical analysis. It was found that two full time operators should be able to detect about 50 potential oviposition sites in one flight season, 28 of which were expected to be real oviposition sites.},

abstract = {Natural environments are characterized by variable wind that can pose significant challenges for flying animals and robots. However, our understanding of the flow conditions that animals experience outdoors and how these impact flight performance remains limited. Here, we combine laboratory and field experiments to characterize wind conditions encountered by foraging bumblebees in outdoor environments and test the effects of these conditions on flight. We used radio-frequency tags to track foraging activity of uniquely identified bumblebee ( Bombus impatiens ) workers, while simultaneously recording local wind flows. Despite being subjected to a wide range of speeds and turbulence intensities, we find that bees do not avoid foraging in windy conditions. We then examined the impacts of turbulence on bumblebee flight in a wind tunnel. Rolling instabilities increased in turbulence, but only at higher wind speeds. Bees displayed higher mean wingbeat frequency and stroke amplitude in these conditions, as well as increased asymmetry in stroke amplitude—suggesting that bees employ an array of active responses to enable flight in turbulence, which may increase the energetic cost of flight. Our results provide the first direct evidence that moderate, environmentally relevant turbulence affects insect flight performance, and suggest that flying insects use diverse mechanisms to cope with these instabilities.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Published by John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd. In social insects, the activity rhythm of foragers and their action range determinate the activity of the colony. In vespids, which are mostly predators, the foraging range of workers determines their maximum predation pressure round the nest. One of these species, Vespa velutina, a recently invasive species introduced into Europe, exerts a strong predation on honeybees at the hive. Therefore, the definition of its activity rhythm and spatial range of predation is of primary importance. Using radio frequency identification tags (RFID), two experiments were carried out to (a) determine their return ability (called homing) in releasing 318 individuals at different distance from their colony and (b) monitor their foraging activity rhythm and the duration of their flights based on 71 individuals followed 24 hr/24 during 2 months. The homing ability of V. velutina was evaluated to be up to 5,000 m and was not affected by the cardinal orientation of release point. The lag time to return to the nest increased with the distance of release. Most of the flight activity took place between 07:00 a.m. and 08:00 p.m., hornets doing principally short flights of less than an hour. Foraging range was thus estimated ca. 1,000 m around the nest. This study of V. velutina assisted by RFID tags provides for the first time a baseline for its potential foraging distance that increase our knowledge of this species to (a) refine more accurately models for risk assessment and (b) define security perimeter for early detection of predation on invasion front.},

abstract = {Some carabid species are not restricted to a single habitat only, but use various types of habitats. In these species, relatively little is known about the utilization of occupied habitats and factors affecting their movement within these habitats. In this study, we focus on the movement activity of ubiquitous Carabus ullrichii during its reproductive period at the border of two types of habitats, a meadow and a forest. We tracked 21 adult individuals using radio telemetry and recorded in total 1,687 position fixes. Movement activity was associated with the type of habitat and specific environmental conditions such as time of the day and air temperature. Both sexes activated preferably at dusk and during the night, although males were most active at temperatures around 15°C, while females showed no preference for temperature. Males were able to walk as fast as females, but they were more associated with forest edge. We assume that the inner edge of the forest could be used as a mating site and after mating males stay there and wait for new females with which to mate, while fertilized females disperse into the surroundings. They moved further into the closed forest where they were likely looking for oviposition sites and food resources to support reproduction. Exclusively females were recorded to visit the meadow at a greater distance from the forest edge and their movements there were almost always direct.},

Almost all of the bees maintained accurate compensation for lateral wind drift, and many completed the full length of the vector flight before starting to search for their hive. Our results showed that bees tend to disregard landscape cues during these vector flights, at least initially, and rely on the "optic flow" of the ground beneath them, and their sun compass, to judge both direction and distance.},

abstract = {The wing loading of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), was found to decrease slightly with increasing size over a wide range of individual sizes and independent of sex. This makes it possible to use tags of the same weight for beetles of all sizes and suggests that if the addition of light electronic tags has any effect on the beetle's flight it will be similar across beetle size. The wing loading of individual potato beetles ranged from an average minimum 10.9 N m(-2) to an average maximum of 15.6 N m(-2) as their weights fluctuated over time following water and food uptake or dispersal. However, tests carried out in flight chambers indicate that beetles become incapable of upward flight as they go beyond an average wing loading of 11.8 N m(-2), that is 101 muN (10.3 mg) beyond their minimum weight. It is estimated from our results that electronic tags should weigh no more than 23-33{\%} of the potato beetle's acceptable extra loading for the technique to have no or minimal impact on the number and quality of upward flights taken.},

abstract = {$\backslash$nCapture-mark-recapture (CMR) analyses aim primarily at estimating relevant life history parameters, despite the fact that some individuals are not always recaptured, even if alive on the study site. Applying such approaches to species with a complex life cycle, such as insects, remains challenging because each change of stage tends to cause mark loss through molting. We developed a multistate model based on three exclusive events ("dead," "surviving and molting," and "surviving and staying in the same larval stage") to estimate probabilities of survival and mark loss. Estimates of biologically relevant parameters were derived from those of the probabilities of transition between these states. The model was applied to data from radio-tracking diodes glued on grasshoppers. The estimates of recapture probabilities decreased throughout the season for animals remaining alive, while the detection of dead animals and lost diodes was exhaustive. The survival probability was higher for larvae than for adults (0.98 vs. 0.96), and mark loss was stronger in larvae than in adults (0.09 vs. 0.06). We show that the survival rate of a species with a high rate of mark loss can be estimated using multistate models, provided that marks can be recovered after being lost. These models are flexible enough to test for several effects that potentially affect survival and mark loss probabilities.},

However, little is known about destinations and strategies of individual insects. We attached miniaturized radio transmitters (ca 300 mg) to the thoraxes of 14 individual dragonflies (common green darners, Anax junius) and followed them during their autumn migration for up to 12 days, using receiver-equipped Cessna airplanes and ground teams. Green darners exhibited distinct stopover and migration days. On average, they migrated every 2.9 +/- 0.3 days, and their average net advance was 58 +/- 11 km in 6.1 +/- 0.9 days (11.9 +/- 2.8 km d(-1)) in a generally southward direction (186 +/- 52 degrees). They migrated exclusively during the daytime, when wind speeds were less than 25 km h(-1), regardless of wind direction, but only after two nights of successively lower temperatures (decrease of 2.1 +/- 0.6 degrees C in minimum temperature). The migratory patterns and apparent decision rules of green darners are strikingly similar to those proposed for songbirds, and may represent a general migration strategy for long-distance migration of organisms with high self-propelled flight speeds.},

abstract = {By using harmonic radar, we report the complete flight paths of displaced bees. Test bees forage at a feeder or are recruited by a waggle dance indicating the feeder. The flights are recorded after the bees are captured when leaving the hive or the feeder and are released at an unexpected release site. A sequence of behavioral routines become apparent: (i) initial straight flights in which they fly the course that they were on when captured (foraging bees) or that they learned during dance communication (recruited bees); (ii) slow search flights with frequent changes of direction in which they attempt to "get their bearings"; and (iii) straight and rapid flights directed either to the hive or first to the feeding station and then to the hive. These straight homing flights start at locations all around the hive and at distances far out of the visual catchment area around the hive or the feeding station. Two essential criteria of a map-like spatial memory are met by these results: bees can set course at any arbitrary location in their familiar area, and they can choose between at least two goals. This finding suggests a rich, map-like organization of spatial memory in navigating honey bees.},

abstract = {For the first time, the flight paths of five butterfly species were successfully tracked using harmonic radar within an agricultural landscape. Until now, butterfly mobility has been predominantly studied using visual observations and mark-recapture experiments. Attachment of a light-weight radar transponder to the butterfly's thorax did not significantly affect behaviour or mobility. Tracks were analysed for straightness, duration, displacement, ground speed, foraging and the influence of linear landscape features on flight direction. Two main styles of track were identified: (A) fast linear flight and (B) slower nonlinear flights involving a period of foraging and/or looped sections of flight. These loops potentially perform an orientation function, and were often associated with areas of forage. In the absence of forage, linear features did not provide a guiding effect on flight direction, and only dense treelines were perceived as barriers.

abstract = {We used radiotelemetry and/or chemical light-tags to track the flight of 15 individuals of Scapanes australis in Madang Province, Papua New Guinea. This species causes severe economic impacts on coconut palms in young plantations. Flights to feeding, mating, resting, and possibly oviposition sites covered distances of 52 to 835 m in males, and from 245 m to {\textgreater}1000 m in females. Upon release, females flew in a tight upward spiral above canopy level ({\textgreater}20 m), then usually flew along a single bearing out of radio reception within 1 min of initiating flight. Dispersing females probably follow scent trails to pheromone-releasing males that occupy feeding galleries excavated most frequently in coconut palms, or search for oviposition sites. Most tagged females were not found again, because they dispersed beyond the tracking capabilities of our radio-receivers, but one female was followed for 245 m to a feeding gallery excavated by an adult male. Males typically flew within 5 m of the ground, took erratic flight paths with numerous turns, and frequently circled coconuts and other host plants. We followed males from the release point until they ceased flight for a night. Males passed daylight hours either in a feeding gallery within a host plant or under soil litter.},

abstract = {Foraging activity in social insects should be regulated by colony nutritional status and food availability, such that both the emission of, and response to, recruitment signals depend on current conditions. Using fully automatic radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology to follow the foraging activity of tagged bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) during 16,000 foraging bouts, we tested whether the cue provided by stored food (the number of full honeypots) could modulate the response of workers to the recruitment pheromone signal. Artificial foraging pheromones were applied to colonies with varied levels of food reserves. The response to recruitment pheromones was stronger in colonies with low food, resulting in more workers becoming active and more foraging bouts being performed. In addition to previous reports showing that in colonies with low food successful foragers perform more excited runs during which they release recruitment pheromone and inactive workers are more prone to leave the nest following nectar influx, our results indicate that evolution has shaped a third pathway that modulates bumblebee foraging activity, thus preventing needless energy expenditure and exposure to risk when food stores are already high. This new feedback loop is intriguing since it involves context-dependent response to a signal. It highlights the integration of information from both forager-released pheromones (signal) and nutritional status (cue) that occurs within individual workers before making the decision to start foraging. Our results support the emerging view that responses to pheromones may be less hardwired than commonly acknowledged.},

abstract = {Many insects living in ancient trees are assumed to be threatened as a result of habitat loss and fragmentation. It is generally expected that species in habitats with low temporal variability in carrying capacity have lower degree of dispersal in comparison to those in more ephemeral habitats. As hollow trees are long-lived, species in that habitat are expected to be sensitive to habitat fragmentation, due to a low capacity to establish new populations far from present ones. Using radio telemetry, we studied the dispersal for a beetle, Osmoderma eremita, living in hollow trees. O. eremita exhibited philopatry and only dispersed over short ranges. About 82–88{\%} of the adults remained in the tree where they were caught. All observed dispersal movements ended up in nearby hollow trees and 62{\%} in the neighbouring hollow tree. These results corroborate the suggestion that habitat fragmentation may be detrimental to insects living in temporally stable but spatially variable habitats. In order to preserve such species, we propose that conservation efforts should be focused on maintaining or increasing the number of suitable trees in and near presently occupied stands.},

abstract = {Foraging range, an important component of bee ecology, is of considerable interest for insect-pollinated plants because it determines the potential for outcrossing among individuals. However, long-distance pollen flow is difficult to assess, especially when the plant also relies on self-pollination. Pollen movement can be estimated indirectly through population genetic data, but complementary data on pollinator flight distances is necessary to validate such estimates. By using radio-tracking of cowpea pollinator return flights, we found that carpenter bees visiting cowpea flowers can forage up to 6 km from their nest. Foraging distances were found to be shorter than the maximum flight range, especially under adverse weather conditions or poor reward levels. From complete flight records in which bees visited wild and domesticated populations, we conclude that bees can mediate gene flow and, in some instances, allow transgene (genetically engineered material) escape over several kilometers. However, most between-flower flights occur within plant patches, while very few occur between plant patches.},

We hypothesise that when a food source at a known location ceases to be available, flying insects will exhibit search patterns that optimise the rediscovery of such resources. In order to study these searching patterns, foraging honeybees were trained to an artificial feeder that was then removed, and the subsequent flight patterns of the bees were recorded using harmonic radar. We show that the flight patterns have a scale-free (L{\'{e}}vy-flight) characteristic that constitutes an optimal searching strategy for the location of the feeder. It is shown that this searching strategy would remain optimal even if the implementation of the L{\'{e}}vy-flights was imprecise due, for example, to errors in the bees' path integration system or difficulties in responding to variable wind conditions. The implications of these findings for animal foraging in general are discussed.},

abstract = {Migratory movements of the endangered stag beetles Lucanus cervus (18 males, 38 females) were monitored radio-telemetrically for three reproductive periods (2003–2005). The aim of the study was to estimate the migratory range of free- ranging individuals as a measure of connectivity among neighbouring populations for future conservation measures. Miniature transmitters of c. 350mg (battery life: 10–15 days) were attached externally to the pronotum. Transmitter/beetle mass ratio was 12.8{\%} on average (7.1–28.0{\%}). Male dispersal behaviour consisted of frequent flights directed to sites with reproductive females and rarely of on-ground movement. Total displacement distance recorded was up to 2065m, the maximum distance of a single flight being 1720m. Flights always began at elevated structures such as trees and shrubs and took place in an air temperature range of 11–27 1C. Within this range, temperature did not influence flight distance. Female dispersal behaviour consisted mostly of a single flight, followed by mating and consequent ground movements towards oviposition sites. Total displacement distance re- corded was up to 762.6 m, the maximum distance of a single flight being 701 m. Climatic constraints of flights were the same as in males. Modelling the dispersal behaviour suggests that about 1{\%} of males are capable of maintaining gene flux among nest sites within a radius of about 3 km. However, the colonization of new nest sites depends on the dispersal ability of females and amounts to less than 1km. Thus, isolated populations (distance to the next population greater than 3km) have an increased probability of local extinction.},

Individual male turnip moths, Agrotis segetum (Denis {\&} Schifferm{\"{u}}ller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), tagged with radar transponders, were released and tracked in plots with or without disruptive doses of sex pheromone. In addition, male attraction to pheromone-baited traps and mating of calling females in treated and untreated plots was investigated. High doses of a four-component pheromone blend reduced trap catch by 79{\%} and mating of females by 62{\%} when compared with control plots in pre-radar experiments. Surprisingly, this effect was not associated with any pronounced differences in flight behaviour of males between a treatment and a control plot as revealed by harmonic radar recordings. In total, 20 flight tracks from a control plot and 22 flight tracks from a treatment plot were analysed. Moths could be followed for up to 77 min, corresponding to a track length of 7350 m. Mean ground speed ranged from 0.7 m s−1 to 5.4 m s−1. There was a strong trend (P = 0.06) for a greater number of male orientations to traps from downwind in the control field compared to the treatment field. Many flight tracks were fragmented due to radar shadow. Advantages and constraints using harmonic radar to study the pheromone-mediated flight behaviour of nocturnal moths are discussed.},

Little is known about the causes of these outbreaks or the causes of en masse migrations during outbreaks. 2. Flightless Mormon crickets (Anabrus simplex) were the focus of this study. They are a katydid species that forms large, dense, mobile groups (migratory bands) during outbreak periods, eating vegetation in their path. 3. Radiotelemetric methods were used to measure differences in movement rate and directionality in outbreak and non-outbreak populations, testing the hypothesis that these populations differ in their travel rate and consistency of direction. 4. Daily individual movement in outbreak populations differs substantially from non-outbreak populations that are at much lower density. In addition to large differences in distances travelled (1.6 km as compared with 1 m) and rates of travel, there is evidence for collective movement among individual Mormon crickets travelling in migratory bands. 5. These data suggest that the direction of group movement may be influenced by local environmental conditions such as wind direction and movement of nearby band members. This work forms the basis for ongoing work testing hypotheses about mass migrations in outbreak populations.},

The frequency of the larger Colorado potato beetles crossing bare ground or grassy plots was unaffected by the presence of an 8 cm trailing harmonic radar tag. However, plum curculios and western corn rootworms, were either unable to walk with a 4 cm trailing tag (plum curculio) or displayed a reduced ability to successfully cross a bare ground arena. Our results revealed the significant impact of vegetation on successful insect dispersal, whether tagged or not. The vertical movement of these insects on stems, stalks, and tubes was also unaffected by the presence of vertical tags. Trailing tags had a significant negative effect on the vertical movement of the western corn rootworm. Results show that harmonic radar technology is a suitable method for studying the walking paths of the three insects with appropriate tag type and size. The nuisance factor generated by appropriately sized tags was small relative to that of vegetation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Published by John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd. The yellow-legged Asian hornet is an invasive species of wasps, indigenous to the Southeast Asia but recently spreading in Southern Europe. Because of its exponential diffusion and its serious threat to the local honeybee colonies (and to humans as well), restraint measures are currently under investigation. We developed and tested an harmonic radar capable of tracking the flying trajectory of these insects, once equipped with a small transponder, in their natural environment. Several hornets were captured close to a small cluster of honeybee hives, tagged with different transponders and then released in order to follow the flight toward their nest. On-field testing proved an initial maximum detection range of about 125 m in a hilly and woody area. A number of detections were clearly recorded, and preferential directions of flight were identified. The system herein described is intended as a first low-cost harmonic radar; it proved the capability to track the hornets while flying and it permitted to test the tagging techniques. Several upgrades of the system have been identified during this work and are extensively described in the last chapter. The designed system has three major advantages over conventional harmonic radars. First and most importantly, it adopts advanced processing techniques to suppress clutter and to improve target detection. Second, it allows radar operations in complex environments, generally hilly and rich in vegetation. Finally, it can continuously track tagged insects (24/7) and in any meteorological condition, providing an effective tool in order to locate the nests of the yellow-legged Asian hornet.},

abstract = {Visual observation enables a good understanding of beneficial insect behaviour within a locality, but once the rapidly dispersing beneficial insects walk or fly, they are soon lost from view. The harmonic radar tracking system developed to follow Colorado potato beetles, Leptinotarsa decemlineata in flight is proposed as a useful technique to increase the study range of beneficial insects from that of the plant to that of the landscape. These insects belong to a wide array of orders and families and many are small in size. Nevertheless, we estimated that some 15{\%} of beneficial insects are at least similar in length to the chrysomelid beetle for which the feasibility of using a portable harmonic radar has been successfully demonstrated. As for the Colorado beetle, the pulsed radar transmitter, the tag, the antenna gain and the receiver of the portable radar system must be carefully designed to provide both a sufficient tracking range and a sufficient beam width. The construction of the tag is strongly limited by the load-carrying ability of the beneficial insect to be tracked. For the tracking of normal insect dispersal tags must, by definition, be lighter than the maximum carrying ability for extra loads and within the wing loading range of each species. It has been shown that in herbivorous insects and mosquitoes the ability to fly may be traded against the opportunity to acquire a large meal. This trade-off, which limits the ability of the insects to carry extra loads, should be less likely to occur with beneficial species that have to remain highly mobile to locate and capture prey for example. This was supported by our findings for Hippodamia convergens and Harmonia axyridis (Coccinellidae), both of which retain their ability to fly over the full range of their wing loading values. Tests conducted in the laboratory showed that these two beneficial insects can display normal flight behaviour with tags representing a similar percentage of their body mass as those successfully developed for the Colorado beetle and only slightly higher than for the other ones reported in the literature. The application of the portable harmonic radar technology to the study of flight by beneficial insects is therefore feasible and worth developing further. The main challenge is in the development of electronic tags with a sufficiently small absolute mass. Many options available immediately and others with potential are discussed},

abstract = {Like many other nocturnal arthropods, the amblypygid Phrynus pseudoparvulus is capable of homing. The environment through which these predators navigate is a dense and heterogeneous tropical forest understory and the mechanism(s) underlying their putatively complex navigational abilities are presently unknown. This study explores the sensory inputs that might facilitate nocturnal navigation in the amblypygid P. pseudoparvulus. Specifically, we use sensory system manipulations in conjunction with field displacements to examine the potential involvement of multimodal - olfactory and visual - stimuli in P. pseudoparvulus' homing behavior. In a first experiment, we deprived individuals of their olfactory capacity and displaced them to the opposite side of their home trees ({\textless}5. m). We found that olfaction-intact individuals were more likely to be re-sighted in their home refuges than olfaction-deprived individuals. In a second experiment, we independently manipulated both olfactory and visual sensory capacities in conjunction with longer-distance displacements (8. m) from home trees. We found that sensory-intact individuals tended to be re-sighted on their home tree more often than sensory-deprived individuals, with a stronger effect of olfactory deprivation than visual deprivation. Comparing across sensory modality manipulations, olfaction-manipulated individuals took longer to return to their home trees than vision-manipulated individuals. Together, our results indicate that olfaction is important in the nocturnal navigation of P. pseudoparvulus and suggest that vision may also play a more minor role.},

In the laboratory, the strength of the glue bond between the radar tag and H. halys pronotum was significantly increased when the pronotum was sanded to remove cuticular waxes. The adhesive bond of the radar tag to the sanded pronotum of H. halys had strength of 160-190-g force and there was no significant difference among the three types of glue tested. The three glues had no measurable effect on the survivorship of radar-tagged H. halys over 7 d, compared with untagged insects. Over a 7-d period in the laboratory, horizontal distance traveled, horizontal walking velocity, and vertical climbing distance were all unaffected by the presence of the tags regardless of glue. A field experiment was conducted to compare the free flight behavior of untagged and radar-tagged H. halys. Adults were released on a vertical dowel and their flights were tracked visually up to ≍200 m from the release point. There was no significant difference in take-off time or in flight distance, time, or speed between untagged and radar-tagged individuals. In addition, prevailing flight direction was not significantly different between untagged and radar-tagged individuals. The absence of measurable impact of the radar tag attachment on H. halys survivorship or mobility validates the use of harmonic radar tags to study the dispersal ecology of this insect in field conditions.},

If long-distance movements are habitual, rare plants in widely scattered locations may benefit from euglossine pollination services. Here we report the first successful use of micro radio telemetry to track the movement of an insect pollinator in a complex and forested environment. Our results indicate that individual male orchid bees (Exaerete frontalis) habitually use large rainforest areas (at least 42-115 ha) on a daily basis. Aerial telemetry located individuals up to 5 km away from their core areas, and bees were often stationary, for variable periods, between flights to successive localities. These data suggest a higher degree of site fidelity than what may be expected in a free living male bee, and has implications for our understanding of biological activity patterns and the evolution of forest pollinators.},

abstract = {Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are regularly faced with the task of navigating back to their hives from remote food sources. They have evolved several methods to do this, including compass-directed ''vector'' flights and the use of landmarks. If these hive-centered mechanisms are disrupted, bees revert to searching for the hive, but the nature and efficiency of their searching strategy have hitherto been unknown. We used harmonic radar to record the flight paths of honey bees that were searching for their hives. Our subsequent analysis of these paths revealed that they can be represented by a series of straight line segments that have a scale-free, Le´vyLe´vy distribution with an inverse-square-law tail. We show that these results, combined with the ''no preferred direction'' characteristic of the segments, demonstrate that the bees were flying an optimal search pattern. Le´vyLe´vy movements have already been identified in a number of other animals. Our results are the best reported example where the movements are mostly attributable to the adoption of an optimal, scale-free searching strategy.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Harmonic radar technology can be used to track the$\backslash$ndispersal of tagged insects. The tag consists of a wire antenna attached$\backslash$nto a Schottky diode, which uses the original radar signal as$\backslash$nan energy source, re-emitting a harmonic of the transmitted wavelength.$\backslash$nTwo forms of harmonic radar use this basic technology to$\backslash$nstudy insect movement. The more sophisticated form consists of a$\backslash$nground-based scanning radar station that tracks the movement of a$\backslash$ntagged insect on a circular radar display. A simpler, “off-the-shelf”$\backslash$nform of harmonic radar is a commercially available, light-weight,$\backslash$nhandheld transmitter/receiver from RECCO Rescue Systems. We$\backslash$nbriefly review both of these forms and describe our experience$\backslash$nmonitoring the movement of carabid beetles in agricultural habitats$\backslash$nwith the handheld transmitter/receiver. We identified a commercial$\backslash$nsource of diodes compatible with the RECCO transmitter/receiver$\backslash$nand tested several diode and wire combinations. We found that a tag$\backslash$nbuilt with a diode attached to a single section of 8-cm wire (monopole)$\backslash$nwas more appropriate for marking carabids. Tags built from$\backslash$nflexible Teflon-coated wires were an improvement on tags built with$\backslash$nstiff, aluminum wire, but beetle movement was still hindered. In corn$\backslash$nand soybean fields, large carabids (Scarites quadriceps Chaudoir and$\backslash$nHarpalus pennsylvanicus, (DeG.)

We discuss the trade-offs between tag detection and$\backslash$ndurability that occur when designing a tag for a given organism.$\backslash$nAlthough the technique shows promise, producing a tag that does$\backslash$nnot hinder movement of the target insect in the field will require$\backslash$nfurther development.},

abstract = {To predict how organisms cope with habitat fragmentation we must understand their dispersal biology, which can be notoriously difficult. We used a novel, multi-pronged approach to study dispersal strategies in the endangered saproxylic hermit beetle Osmoderma eremita, exploiting its pheromone system to intercept high numbers of dispersing individuals, which is not possible with other methods. Mark-release-recapture, using unbaited pitfall traps inside oak hollows and pheromone-baited funnel traps suspended from tree branches, was combined with radio telemetry (in females only) to record displacements. Dispersal, modelled as a probability distribution of net displacement, did not differ significantly between sexes (males versus females recaptured), observation methods (females recaptured versus radio-tracked), or sites of first capture (pitfall trap in tree versus pheromone trap - distance from original dispersal point unknown). A model including all observed individuals yielded a mean displacement of 82 m with 1{\%} dispersing {\textgreater} 1 km. Differences in body length were small between individuals captured in pitfall versus pheromone traps, indicating that dispersal is rarely a condition-dependent response in O. eremita. Individuals captured in pheromone traps were consistently lighter, indicating that most dispersal events occur relatively late in life, which agrees with trap catch data. In addition, most (79{\%}) females captured in pheromone traps were mated, showing that females typically mate before leaving their natal tree. Our data show that integrating odour attractants into insect conservation biology provides a means to target dispersing individuals and could greatly improve our knowledge of dispersal biology in threatened species.},

abstract = {Harmonic radar tracking system for insects has been introduced to understand insect movement, particularly those which move at low altitudes and over relatively short ranges. Although entomologists have used direct observation and mark-and-recapture techniques as tracking methods, there are drawbacks such as low recapture rates in the case of marking techniques. The objective of this study was to quantitatively examine adhesive bond strength between radar tag and insect body and to evaluate the effect of tag attachment on flight behavior and capacity of five economically important insect species, including three pest species, Riptortus pedestris (Hemiptera: Alydidae), Lycorma delicatula (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae), and Ricania sp. (Hemiptera: Ricaniidae) and two pollinators, Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae). The adhesive bond strength was substantially different among these five insect species, but the strength was sufficiently strong for operational use in harmonic radar tagging except in Ricania sp. Bond strength on B. terrestris was 817 ± 43.65 g-forces, which was the strongest among the five species tested, while that on Ricania sp. was 1.7 ± 0.20 g-forces, which was the weakest. For all insects, no significant correlation between bond strength and insect body size was observed. The radar tag attachment affected the flight behavior and capacity of five insect species in different ways. The radar tag attachment did not significantly affect the propensity of R. pedestris, L. delicatula, or B. terrestris to takeoff compared to untagged individuals. However, the takeoff propensities of A. mellifera and Ricania sp. were negatively affected by the radar tag attachment. Flight capacities of R. pedestris, A. mellifera, and B. terrestris were not affected by the tag attachment compared to untagged individuals, but the flight capacity of Ricania sp. was negatively affected by the tag attachment. The results of this study indicate that the radar technique has promising potential for R. pedestris, L. delicatula, and B. terrestris. However, this technique may have limited potential for A. mellifera and Ricania sp. because the radar tag can significantly affect their flight behavior.},

@article{Decourtye2011,
abstract = {Losses of foraging bees are sometimes attributed to altered flight pattern between a meliferous plant treated with an insecticide and the hive. Only a limited number of studies has investigated the impact of pesticides on homing flight due to the difficulty of measuring the flight time between the food source and the hive. Monitoring the flights of the foraging bees needs their individual identification. The number of bees monitored simultaneously and the time span during which observations can be made limit most of the monitoring techniques. However, techniques of automatic tracking and identification of individuals have the potential to revolutionize the study of the ecotoxicological effects of xenobiotics on the bee behaviors. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) offer numerous advantages such as an unlimited number of codes, a large number of simultaneous recording, and a quick reading, especially through materials (e.g., wood). The aim of this study was to show how the RFID device can be used to study the effects of pesticides on both the behavioral traits and the lifespan of bees. In this context, we have developed a method under tunnel to automatically record the displacements of foragers individualized with RFID tags and to detect the alteration of the flight pattern between an artificial feeder and the hive. Fipronil was selected as test substance due to the lack of information on the effects of this insecticide on the foraging behavior of free-flying bees. We showed that oral treatment of 0.3 ng of fipronil per bee (LD50/20) reduced the number of foraging trips. The strengths of our approach were briefly discussed.},
